# 2025.03 - Data Release Log

# New to Datafiniti

## New Parking Data Fields

We've enhanced our property data schema with the introduction of a new field for more detailed parking information:

* numParkingSpaces – This existing field includes the total number of available parking spots at a property.
* numGarageSpace – This newly added field specifies the number of garage-specific parking spaces, providing more granular information.

Not all data sources differentiate between general parking and garage parking, making this addition a valuable enhancement for more accurate property assessments.

## New People Data Schema Field

To improve integration between people and property data, we've added a new field to our people data schema:

* propertyKeys – A person’s generated key from Datafiniti, which can be used for comparison in the property search API endpoint.

This addition makes cross-referencing individuals with property records more seamless, enhancing data connectivity.

# Coming Soon

## Redesigned Datafiniti.co Landing Page

We're revamping our [www.datafiniti.co](http://www.datafiniti.co) landing page to improve navigation, usability, and showcase how our data empowers businesses. Stay tuned for the launch of our fresh, user-friendly design!

## Improved Autotrace Property Data

We're working on a powerful new feature for property data searches. The auto\_trace parameter will allow you to combine data from both people and property datasets in a single API call. This enhancement will:

* Use the standard property search API with minor differences.
* Pull property records with newly added homeowner contact information.
* Simplify the process of connecting properties to their owners.

Additionally, auto trace property searches via the portal will allow users to retrieve detailed homeowner information directly from our people database, making property and people data integration more accessible.
