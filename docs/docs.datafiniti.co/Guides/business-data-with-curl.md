# Business Data with cURL

For this guide, we're going to assume you're interested in using Datafiniti's business data to do some marketing analysis on hotels.  Let's say you're a data scientist that's been tasked with the following:

1. Collecting data on hotels in the US.
2. Sort the business data by state.
3. Find which states have the most hotels.

**Your environment and data needs:**

1. You're working with cURL.
2. You want to work with CSV or JSON data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

## 1. Open your terminal

If you want to use cURL to access the Datafiniti API, we're assuming you have access to a standard, Linux-based terminal.  Open a terminal session to get started.

## 2. Get your API token

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the [Datafiniti Web Portal (https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings), login, and click your settings in the left navigation bar.  From there, you'll see a page showing your token.  Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Copy the API token or store it somewhere you can easily reference.

> 📘 API Key
>
> For the rest of this document, we'll use `AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX` as a substitute example for your actual API token when showing example API calls.

> 🚧 API Key Regen
>
> For security reasons, your API token will be automatically changed whenever you change your password.

## 3. Run your first search

The first thing we'll do is do a test search that will give us a sense for what sort of data might be available.  Eventually we'll refine our search so that we get back the most relevant data.

Since we want hotels, let's try a simple search that will just give us online listings for hotels.

Enter the following into your terminal (replace the dummy API token with your real API token):

```curl
curl --request POST --url https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/businesses/search --header 'authorization: Bearer AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX' --data '{"query":"categories:hotel","format:json","num_records":1}'
```

You should get a response similar to this (although it may not look as pretty in your terminal):

```

Let's break down each of the parameters we sent in our request:

| API Call Component             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"query": "categories:hotels"` | `query` tells the API what you want to search.  In this case, you're telling the API you want to search by `categories`.  Any business that has `hotels` listed in its `categories` field will be returned. |
| `"num_records": 1`             | `num_records` tells the API how many records to return in its response.  In this case, you just want to see 1 matching record.                                                                              |
| `"format":"xxxx"`              | `format` tells the API what format to output the data in the response. Can be either `CSV` or `JSON`                                                                                                        |

Now let's dive through the response the API returned:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Response Field",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "`\"num_found\"`",
    "0-1": "The total number of available records in the database that match your query.  If you end up downloading the entire data set, this is how many records you'll use.",
    "1-0": "`\"total_cost\"`",
    "1-1": "The number of credits this request has cost you.  Business records only cost 1 credit per record.",
    "2-0": "`\"records\"`",
    "2-1": "The first available matches to your query. If there are no matches, this field will be empty.  \n  \nWithin each record returned, you'll see multiple fields shown.  This is the data for each record."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 3,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

Within the `records` field, you'll see a single business returned with multiple fields and the values associated with that business.  The JSON response will show all fields that have a value.  It won't show any fields that don't have a value.

Each business record will have multiple fields associated with it.  You can see a full list of available fields in our [Business Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/business-data-schema).

## 4. Refine your search

If you think about the original query we made, you'll realize we didn't really specify which geography we're interested in.  Since we only want US hotels, we should narrow our search appropriately.  Modify your request to look like this:

```curl
curl --request POST --url https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/businesses/search --header 'authorization: Bearer AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX' --data '{"query":"categories:hotel AND country:US","format:csv", "num_records": 10}'
```

This API call is different in a couple ways:

1. It adds ` AND country:US` to narrow down results to just US hotels.
2. It sets `num_records` to 10 so we can look at more sample matches.
3. It changes `format` from `JSON` to `CSV`.

Datafiniti lets you construct very refined boolean queries.  If you wanted to do more complicated searches, you could use OR operations, negation, and more.

## 5. Initiate a full download of the data

Once we like what we see from the sample matches, it's time to download a larger data set!  To do this, we're going to further modify our request to look like this:

```curl
curl --request POST --url https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/businesses/search --header 'authorization: Bearer AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX' --data '{"query":"categories:hotel AND country:US","format:csv","view": "business_basic", "download": true}'
```

Here's what we changed:

1. We change `"num_records": 10` to `"num_records": 50`.  This will download the first 50 matching records.  If we wanted to download all matching records, we would remove `num_records`.
2. We added `"view": "business_basic"`.  If you don't specify `view`, it will show all available fields.  Using `business_basic` will nest fields like categories and features into a single cell (instead splitting them across multiple rows and columns).
3. We added `"download": true`.  This tells the API to issue a download request instead of a search request.

> 🚧 Num\_records
>
> If num\_records is not specified, ALL of the records matching the query will be downloaded.

When you make this API call, you'll see a response similar to:

```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "results": [],
    "user_id": 15,
    "status": "running",
    "date_started": "2017-11-16 17:46:06.0",
    "num_downloaded": 0,
    "data_type": "business",
    "query": "categories:hotels AND country:US",
    "format": "CSV",
    "num_records": 50,
  	"total_cost": 50
}
```

We'll explain each of these fields in the next section.

## 6. Monitor the status of the download

As the download request runs, you can check on its status by making a call to the `/downloads/` endpoint like so:

```curl
curl --request GET --url https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/downloads/XXXX --header 'authorization: Bearer AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

You'll want to replace `XXXX` with the `id` value for your request.  If you keep running this call, you'll see some of the values update.  Once the download completes, it will look something like this:

```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "results": [
        "https://datafiniti-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/15/7_1.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20171116T174607Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYCTIF46QVBTXWYA%2F20171116%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=ecf13f1bb4b7adfdde1a99143541afd1d12347292eb9ec3f6ed1316c64d4xxxx"
    ],
    "user_id": 15,
    "status": "completed",
    "date_started": "2017-11-16 17:46:06.0",
    "date_updated": "2017-11-16 17:46:07.0",
    "num_downloaded": 50,
    "data_type": "business",
    "query": "categories:hotels AND country:US",
    "format": "json",
    "num_records": 50,
  	"total_cost": 50
}
```

Here's what these fields mean:

| Response Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | This is a unique identifier for the request.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `results`        | This is a list of links for all the result files generated for this data set.  When you first issue the download request, it will be an empty list, but it will populate as the download progresses. |
| `user_id`        | This is an internal id for your user account.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `status`         | This indicates the status of your download.  It will be set to `completed` once the download has finished.                                                                                           |
| `date_started`   | The date and time the download started.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `date_updated`   | The last time the download information was updated.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `num_downloaded` | The number of records that have been downloaded so far.                                                                                                                                              |
| `data_type`      | The data type you queried.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `query`          | The query you ran.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `format`         | The data format you requested.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `num_records`    | The total number of records that will be downloaded.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `total_cost`     | The total number of credits used by this download.  Business records only cost 1 credit per record.                                                                                                  |

## 7. Download the result file(s)

Once the download response shows `"status": "completed"`, you can download the data using the URLs in the `results` field.

If you've requested a lot of records (i.e., over 10,000), you may see more than 1 result object shown.

To download the result files, copy each `url` value run a command like:

```curl
curl 'https://datafiniti-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX/6073_1.txt?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIXQMCWHOZB3O35SA&Signature=2YtBsW9xY8CZrWDECcdLzyx4Jlk%3D&Expires=1484754763' > output.txt
```

You'll probably want to rename `output.txt` to something specific to this request.

## 8. Parse the data

### Open the result file(s) in Excel

For files formatted as CSV, you will receive you files as `downloadID_#.csv`. You can navigate to the file you downloaded and open it.  Since it's a CSV file, it should open in Excel automatically.  It will look something like:

![](https://files.readme.io/e200451-people.png "people.png")

### Parse JSON data

The download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.

We'll need to parse the file into an array of JSON objects.  We can use code similar to this to handle the parsing:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Set the location of your file here
FILE="xxxx_x.txt"

# Read each line, assuming each line contains a JSON object
while IFS= read -r line
do
  # Print the record (like print_r in PHP)
  echo "$line"

  # If you want to send it somewhere, use curl (example API endpoint)
  # Replace <API_URL> with your actual API endpoint
  curl -X POST "<API_URL>" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "$line"

done < "$FILE"
```

You can edit the code in the `while` loop above to do whatever you'd like with the data, such as store the data in a database, write it out to your console, etc.

Navigate to the file you downloaded and open it.

> 📘 JSON Format
>
> The JSON data will actually be a text file, instead of a single JSON object. Each line in the text file is a JSON object. We format the data this way because most programming languages won't handle parsing the entire data set as a JSON object with their standard system calls very well.

From here, you'll most likely want to process the data using the programming language of your choice. Our other [JSON guides](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/getting-started-with-product-data) provide instructions on how to process this data.
