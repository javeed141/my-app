# Property Data with Postman

For this guide, we're going to assume you're interested in using Datafiniti's property data to do some marketing analysis on homes in the US.  Let's say you're a data scientist that's been tasked with the following:

1. Collect data on homes.
2. Sort the data by state.
3. Find which states have the most expensive homes.

**Your environment and data needs:**

1. You're working with Postman.
2. You want to work with CSV or JSON data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

## 1. Download Postman

We recommend using Postman when accessing the Datafiniti API.  It's a great client for using any sort of RESTful API and works particularly well with Datafiniti.  You can download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## 2. Get your API token

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the [Datafiniti Web Portal (https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api), login, and click your settings in the left navigation bar.  From there, you'll see a page showing your token.  Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Copy the API token or store it somewhere you can easily reference.

> 📘 API Key
>
> For the rest of this document, we'll use `AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX` as a substitute example for your actual API token when showing example API calls.

> 🚧 API Key Regen
>
> For security reasons, your API token will be automatically changed whenever you change your password.

## 3. Run your first search

The first thing we'll do is do a test search that will give us a sense for what sort of data might be available.  Eventually we'll refine our search so that we get back the most relevant data.

Since we want homes in the US, let's try a simple search that will just give us online listings for US-based properties.

With Postman open, click on the Datafiniti API V4 collection.  Then navigate to Secured Endpoints > Search > Search Property Data.  Click on "Body" in the main screen.

Enter the following in the text area:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US",
  "num_records": 1
}
```

Click the blue "Send" button.  You should get a response similar to this:

```json

        }
      ],
      "id": "AV9WzHyO_RWkykBuv11F"
    }
  ]
]
```

Let's break down each of the parameters we sent in our request:

| API Call Component      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"query": "country:US"` | `query` tells the API what you want to search.  In this case, you're telling the API you want to search by `country`.  Any property in the US will be returned. |
| `"num_records": 1`      | `num_records` tells the API how many records to return in its response.  In this case, you just want to see 1 matching record.                                  |
| `"format":"xxxx"`       | `"format"` tells the API what format to output the data in the response. Can be either `CSV` or `JSON`                                                          |

Now let's dive through the response the API returned:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Response Field",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "`\"num_found\"`",
    "0-1": "The total number of available records in the database that match your query.  If you end up downloading the entire data set, this is how many records you'll use.",
    "1-0": "`\"total_cost\"`",
    "1-1": "The number of credits this request has cost you.  Property records only cost 1 credit per record.",
    "2-0": "`\"records\"`",
    "2-1": "The first available matches to your query. If there are no matches, this field will be empty.  \n  \nWithin each record returned, you'll see multiple fields shown.  This is the data for each record."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 3,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

Within the `records` field, you'll see a single property returned with multiple fields and the values associated with that property.  The API response will show all fields that have a value.  It won't show any fields that don't have a value.

Each property record will have multiple fields associated with it.  You can see a full list of available fields in our [Property Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema).

## 4. Refine your search

If you think about the original query we made, you'll realize we didn't really specify we only wanted homes for sale.  There are several other types of properties (e.g., commercial, rentals) that may also be in the data.  Since we only want homes for sale, we should narrow our search appropriately.  Modify your request body to look like this:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\"",
  "format":"CSV",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

This API call is different in a couple ways:

1. It adds ` AND propertyType:"Single Family Dwelling"` to narrow down results to just US hotels.
2. It changes `records=1` to `records=10` so we can look at more sample matches.
3. It adds `"format":"CSV",` to the code for outputting a csv format in the response.

> 📘 Format
>
> Note that you have the commented line to change between CSV and JSON format. You may change this by comment out the format you do not want.

Datafiniti lets you construct very refined boolean queries.  If you wanted to do more complicated searches, you could OR operations, negation, and more.

Hit "Send" to see the updated results.

If you would like to narrow your search to just exact matches you can place the search term in quotation marks.

## 5. Initiate a download of the data

Once we like what we see from the sample matches, it's time to download a larger data set!  To do this, we're going to further modify our request body to look like this:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\"",
  "format":"CSV",
  "num_records": 50,
  "download": true
}
```

Here's what we changed:

1. We changed `"num_records": 10` to `"num_records": 50`.  This will download the first 50 matching records.  If we wanted to download all matching records, we would remove `num_records`. `num_records` will tell the API to default to all available records.
2. We added `"download": true`.  This tells the API to issue a download request instead of a search request.

> 🚧 Num\_records
>
> If num\_records is not specified, ALL of the records matching the query will be downloaded.

When you make this API call, you'll see a response similar to:

```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "results": [],
    "user_id": 15,
    "status": "running",
    "date_started": "2017-11-16 17:46:06.0",
    "num_downloaded": 0,
    "data_type": "property",
    "query": "country:US AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\"",
    "format": "csv",
    "num_records": 50,
  	"total_cost": 50
}
```

We'll explain each of these fields in the next section.

> 🚧 Credit limit monitoring
>
> When using the API, you will not receive any warning if you are going past your monthly record limit.  Keep a track on how many records you have left by checking your account.  You are responsible for monitoring your monthly limit. To learn more about your credit limit please review [How Credits Work](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/how-credits-work-api).

## 6. Monitor the status of the download

As the download request runs, you can check on its status by using the "Get Download" call in your Postman collection.  Just replace `:id` with the `ID` value you saw in the previous step.

If you keep running this call, you'll see some of the values update.  Once the download completes, it will look something like this:

```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "results": [
        "https://datafiniti-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/15/7_1.csv?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20171116T174607Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYCTIF46QVBTXWYA%2F2017xxxx%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=ecf13f1bb4b7adfdde1a99143541afd1d12347292eb9ec3f6ed1316c64d4eekf"
    ],
    "user_id": 15,
    "status": "completed",
    "date_started": "2017-11-16 17:46:06.0",
    "date_updated": "2017-11-16 17:46:07.0",
    "num_downloaded": 1,
    "data_type": "property",
    "query": "country:US AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\"",
    "format": "csv",
    "num_records": 50,
  	"total_cost": 50
}
```

Here's what these fields mean:

| Response Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ID`             | This is a unique identifier for the request.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `results`        | This is a list of links for all the result files generated for this data set.  When you first issue the download request, it will be an empty list, but it will populate as the download progresses. |
| `user_id`        | This is an internal id for your user account.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `status`         | This indicates the status of your download.  It will be set to `completed` once the download has finished.                                                                                           |
| `date_started`   | The date and time the download started.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `date_updated`   | The last time the download information was updated.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `num_downloaded` | The number of records that have been downloaded so far.                                                                                                                                              |
| `data_type`      | The data type you queried.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `query`          | The query you ran.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `total_cost`     | The number of credits this request has cost you.  Property records only cost 1 credit per record.                                                                                                    |

## 7. Download the result file(s)

Once the download response shows `"status": "completed"`, you can download the data using the URLs in the `results` field.

If you've requested a lot of records (i.e., over 10,000), you may see more than 1 result object shown.

To download the result files, copy each `url` value and paste it into your browser.  Your browser will initiate a download to your computer.

## 8. Parse the data

Navigate to the results file URL or you download page [here](https://portal.datafiniti.co/download) and open the file(s) pertaining to your download ID.

> 📘 Json format
>
> The JSON data will actually be a text file, instead of a single JSON object. Each line in the text file is a JSON object. We format the data this way because most programming languages won't handle parsing the entire data set as a JSON object with their standard system calls very well. Commonly known as NDJSON.

From here, you'll most likely want to process the data using the programming language of your choice. Our other [Getting Started with Property Data](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/getting-started-with-property-data) provide instructions on how to process this data.

### Open the result file(s) in Excel

If your format was `csv` the download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.  Open one of those files in Excel.  It will look something like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8b08d6f8ae5cdf1c77c8c56b6da899a6c006ce27fb76ddfb795aaf0a4f3b50b-image.png)

Using Excel or you preferred data analyzing platform, we can easily count the total number of hotels on a state-by-state basis.  The `province` column gives us where each hotel is located, so we can use it to tally up the numbers.
