Let go through the ways this can happen:\n\n### API Searches\n\nNo matter what data type you are using for a search API call, you are charged credits up to your `num_records` set in the body of the call.\n\nFor example if I search for property using the follow call through postman:\\\nPOST <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/properties/search>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"address:\\\"4801 Yucca Hl Dr\\\" AND province:TX AND (city:Austin OR postalCode:78744)\",\n    \"num_records\":10\n}\n```\n\nYou will recieve this response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"num_found\": 1,\n    \"total_cost\": 1,\n    \"records\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\" \"address\": \"4801 Yucca Hl Dr\",\n            \"brokers\": [\n                {\n                    \"agent\": \"Ryana Stevson\",\n                    \"company\": \"Stevson Property Management\",\n                    \"dateSeen\": \"2023-10-30T04:08:00.000Z\",\n                    \"phones\": [\n                        \"(512) 670-8269\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"agent\": \"Leasing Office\",\n                    \"company\": \"Stetson Property Management\",\n                    \"dateSeen\": \"2024-03-29T17:16:38.560Z\",\n                    \"phones\": [\n                        \"(512) 670-8269\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n}\n\n\n```\n\nIn this case since 1 record was found, only 1 `property_credit_used` was charged.\n\n> 📘 Credits Used On Search May Vary\n>\n> If the credits consumed is under the stated credits consumed by the Search API, Datafiniti will only charge for the amount of records found.\\\n> Example:\\\n> If only 10 records are displayed, we charge 10 credits.\\\n> If 0 records are found, no credits will be charged.\n\nAny time you attempt a download of the records found by a search, a *Download\\_id* will be presented in the response of the API call. Your `total_cost` will dictate how many credits your account was charge on the download.\n\n> 🚧 Overages\n>\n> Depending on the amount of credits needed to download a searched query, you will be charged an overage fee equal to the amount of credits over your credit's available. *NOTE* you will not be able to download the data files generated to your account until the overages are paid. If you do not know if your account is setup for overages, please contact us at <billing@datafiniti.co>\n\n### Enrichment & Suppression API\n\nEnrichment & Suppression API calls are based on the number of `num_record` will be charge against your account upon submitting this request. Once the call is submitted and complete the `total_cost`. (Same as a normal download works) However this total is only comprehensive once the status of the download is complete.\n\nFor more information on [Enrichment & Suppression](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/enrichment-suppression), you can read more about it here.\n\n> ❗️ Before using enrichment & suppression\n>\n> Since Enrichment charge credit per the batch file you are enriching data from, you may be overcharged credits to your account upon submitting a enrichment request. If you do not know if overcharging is enable / disable on your account you may contact <support@datafiniti.co> to find this info out.\n\n## Common credit related errors\n\nYou will always receive and error message when your API or portal request exceed the monthly or yearly limit of credit on your plan.\n\n### API - exceeding your credit limit error\n\nWhether it be via postman, our [Property Data](https://docs.datafiniti.co/reference/properties) reference page, or any other coding language, you will receive a 400 error message when your credit limit will be reached. The error message will look like this.\n\n```json 400\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    \"`num_records` requested will exceed credit allotment for plan.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> ❗️  Exceeding your credit limit\n>\n> If you plan to exceed your credit limit, please contact your Datafiniti customer success representative for refreshing or upgrade your accounts credit limit. Contact us at <support@datafiniti.co> to find this info out.\n\n## Credit limit refresh period\n\nYour credits to your Datafiniti account refresh period is based on of your data plan subscription.
