# Property Data

## New “type” field in prices

Each price entry now includes a type sub-field, which will have one of the following values

* Sale List – indicating that this price is a for sale list price
* Sold – indicating that this price is the price at which the property was sold
* Rental List – indicating that this price is a rental list price
  * The type sub-field replaces isSale and isSold.  These sub-fields will be deprecated on January 31st, 2026.\
    Improved field names

We’ve introduced more descriptive fields to clarify the kind of price shown:

* `mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount `& `mostRecentSaleListPriceDate`
  * The most recent listing date / price of a property within the prices field.
* `mostRecentRentalListPriceAmount` & `mostRecentRentalListPriceDate`
  * The most recent rental date / price of a property within the prices field.
* mostRecentSoldPriceAmount & mostRecentSoldPriceDate
  * The most recent sold date / price of a property within the prices field.

**Why the Change?**

We felt that the  isSale, isSold, and mostRecentPriceAmount were very unclear and not descriptive enough to tell whether a price referred to a listing, sale, or a sold price. This update introduces a standardized structure that eliminates confusion and supports more powerful search and analysis.

**Data Consistency & Reliability**

Existing records using isSale or isSold values are being updatedto reflect the new price.type structure over the next month. We are also adding rental price delineation with “type”:”Rental List” to easily reference rental prices.

**Backward Compatibility**

In order to ease the transition for existing customers using our legacy fields, we’re taking a few steps to ensure backwards compatibility for an extended period. If your integration depends on the isSale, isSold, or mostRecentPriceAmount fields,contact your Customer Success Manager, who can provide a custom view that will continue to include these fields during the migration period.

**Deprecation Timeline**

The legacy fields isSale, isSold, and mostRecentPriceAmount will be fully deprecated by January 31st, 2026. We recommend updating your integrations as soon as possible to take advantage of the new, more structured data model.
