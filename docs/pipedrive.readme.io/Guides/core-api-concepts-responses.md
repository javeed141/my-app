# Responses

All data is sent and received as JSON.

Each response sent from the API contains a `success` parameter, which is of boolean type, indicating whether the request was successful. Upon success being false, an optional `error` parameter (string) may be given. In case of success is true, the response is always contained within a data parameter, and additional metadata may be carried inside an `additional_data` parameter.

## Success response

All success responses follow the same schema:

```json
{
    success: true, //boolean, shows if operation succeeded (similar to HTTP status)
    data: null, //object in other cases
    additional_data: {
        pagination: { //for endpoints that list data
            start: 0,
            limit: 100,
            more_items_in_collection: false
        }
    }
}
```

## Error response

All error responses follow the same schema:

```json
{
    success: false,
    error: "Requested service is not available", //main error message
    error_info: "Please check developers.pipedrive.com",
    data: null,
    additional_data: null
}
```

Error response in the scenario when a customer's account hits a limit for either Deal, custom field, Role or Team creation with the HTTP error code `403`:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Couldn't add the deal. Open deals limit reached.",
    "error_info": "Please check developers.pipedrive.com for more information about Pipedrive API.",
    "data": null,
    "additional_data": null,
    "code": "feature_capping_deals_limit"
}
```
