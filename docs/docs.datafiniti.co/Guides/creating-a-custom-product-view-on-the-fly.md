# Creating a custom product view on the fly

## Introduction

Many Datafiniti customers are interested in using our product data with only specific fields in the record results of a query. In this guide, we will show you a couple of ways to set up a custom view.

## Setting a view in your product Search API

Whenever you set up your product search API body you can create a view by declaring the fields in the JSON of the body. Let's use the following query as a base for a product search:

```json
{
  "query": "domains:amazon AND categories:\"Computer Peripherals\" AND brand:SteelSeries AND reviews:*",
  "num_records":10
}
```

Now let's add the view to the body that allows only the following fields:

* brand
* colors
* gtins
* manufacturerNumber
* mostRecentPriceAmount
* mostRecentPriceNonSalesAmount
* mostRecentPriceDate
* prices - amountMin, amountMax, availability, isSale, offer, sourceURLs

```json
{
  "query": "domains:amazon AND categories:\"Computer Peripherals\" AND brand:SteelSeries AND reviews:*",
  "view": [
        {"name": "brand"},
        {"name": "colors"},
        {"name": "gtins"},
        {"name": "manufacturerNumber"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceAmount"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceNonSalesAmount"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceDate"},
        {"name": "prices","flatten": true, "sub_fields": [
            {"name": "amountMin"},
            {"name": "amountMax"},
            {"name": "availability"},
            {"name": "isSale"},
            {"name": "offer"},
            {"name": "sourceURLs"}
          ]
        }
    ],
  "num_records":10
}
```

## Creating a custom view via create view API endpoint

This method will create a permanent view that you can declare by name in the view of your search body. Using the <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/views> API endpoint you can create a view. We will use the previous fields as our view body. We will name this view `custom_prices_view`.

```json
{
  "name": "custom_prices_view",
  "data_type": "product",
  "fields": [
        {"name": "brand"},
        {"name": "colors"},
        {"name": "gtins"},
        {"name": "manufacturerNumber"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceAmount"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceNonSalesAmount"},
        {"name": "mostRecentPriceDate"},
        {"name": "prices","flatten": true, "sub_fields": [
            {"name": "amountMin"},
            {"name": "amountMax"},
            {"name": "availability"},
            {"name": "isSale"},
            {"name": "offer"},
            {"name": "sourceURLs"}
          ]
        }
    ]
}
```

> 📘 Name
>
> Please note you can name the view any string value not currently used. To check your current view you can use: <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/views?page=1&limit=10>

> 🚧 dataType
>
> Be sure that you declare the correct dataType to the dataType you wish to search. As we need to match the API to the dataType's schema. Learn more about [Product Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-schema).
