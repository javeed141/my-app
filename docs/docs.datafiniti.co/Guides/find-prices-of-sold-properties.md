# Find prices of sold properties

Whether it is property market analytics or building a comp report for your MLS, Datafiniti has data on a sold property to help you. In this guide, we will show how to build a query using Datafiniti's property transaction data to search for sold properties.

# Using transaction data

Our transaction field provides a more in-depth breakdown of what a property sold for in terms of price. We will utilize this field by building a query in the Charlotte North Carolina area.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND transactions:* AND province:NC AND city:charlotte",
    "num_records":1
}
```

Shown here is a sample of the transaction data to expect. To learn more please read the transaction field of [Property Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema)

```json
 "transactions": [
                {
                    "saleDate": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z",
                    "documentType": "Warranty Deed",
                    "price": 434500,
                    "sellerFirstName": "Terry",
                    "sellerLastName": "Carteret",
                    "buyerFirstName": "Hannah",
                    "buyerLastName": "Whilhite",
                    "lenderName": "Maureen Chew Etal",
                    "loanType": "Conventional",
                    "loanAmount": 343000,
                    "mortgageTerm": 360,
                    "parcelNumber": "219-192-16"
                }
```

## Refining the query to a price range

Now we will utilize the price sub-field to build a range of price that we would like to return. Let look for property between 300,000$ and $1,000,000.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND transactions:* AND province:NC AND city:charlotte AND transactions.price:[300000 TO 1000000]",
    "num_records":10
}
```

## Filtering by property type

Let's add a filter for a single family home. For more information on the possible `propertyTypes `you can visit here [Possible Values for Property Fields](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-property-fields)

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND transactions:* AND province:NC AND city:charlotte AND transactions.price:[300000 TO 1000000] AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\"",
    "num_records":1
}
```

## Filtering by sale date

Now, lets say you would like to see if any of these properties sold in the last year. You can use the transactions.saleDate field to search on

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND transactions:* AND province:NC AND city:charlotte AND transactions.price:[300000 TO 1000000] AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND transactions.saleDate:[2023-01-01 TO 2024-01-01]",
    "num_records":1
}
```

> 📘 Data Freshness Notice – Owner & Transaction Data
>
> Homeowner contact details and transaction records are typically available within 2 weeks after a property is marked as sold. This brief processing window allows us to validate, normalize, and match deed and ownership updates to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives.
