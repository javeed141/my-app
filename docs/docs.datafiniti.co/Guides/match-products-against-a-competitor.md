# Match products against a competitor

# Introduction

Making sure you have the right product assortment is imperative to be competitive in the e-commerce space.  It's important to check how your assortment compares to a competing store.  Datafiniti has a few options available to help you with this.

# Matching existing assortment data with the Search API

Let's say you have an existing product data file that looks like this:

```
Product Name, Brand Name, Model Number
Bose X1 Soundbar, Bose, X1
Klipsh New Gen Speakers, Klipsh, NG-1423
Logitech Cordless Soundbar, Logitech, LG1H124
```

You can search for each of these products on a one-by-one basis using Datafiniti's search API.  Here's how one of these searches would look:

```json
{
  "query": "brand:Bose AND manufacturerNumber:\"856990-0110\""
}
```

Datafiniti will return any matching records.  Included in this information will be the `domains` and `sourceURLs` for each product.  This data will look like:

```json
{
  "domains": [
    "www.target.com",
    "www.amazon.com",
    "www.vidlogix.com",
    "www.bestbuy.com",
    "www.bhphotovideo.com",
    "brickseek.com",
    "www.google.com",
    "www.newegg.com",
    "msds.walmartstores.com",
    "www.walmart.com"
  ],
  "sourceURLs": [
    "https://www.target.com/p/bose-tv-speaker-bluetooth-soundbar/-/A-79829337",
    "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088KRPCQJ?productDetails&th=1&psc=1",
    "https://www.vidlogix.com/products/bose-tv-speaker-soundbar",
    "https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/bose-tv-speaker-bluetooth-soundbar-black/6416849",
    "https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1583370-REG/bose_838309_1100_tv_speaker_soundbar.html",
    "https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-tv-speaker-bluetooth-soundbar-with-hdmi-arc-connectivity-black/6416849.p?skuId=6416849",
    "https://brickseek.com/p/bose-tv-speaker-bluetooth-soundbar/9266723",
    "https://www.newegg.com/bose-838309-1100/p/N82E16886942076",
    "https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3302875699079694386/specs",
    "https://www.walmart.com/ip/5NZJPQRHRRZ7"
  ]
}
```

With this information, you know which domains are selling this product.

# Finding the most recent pricing data

Now that you can find the brand / model of a product, know you may want to know where the latest price is. By using the following field, we can find the where the latest price of the product comes from:

* mostRecentPriceAmount
* mostRecentPriceAvailability
* mostRecentPriceByDomain
* mostRecentPriceCurrency
* mostRecentPriceDate
* mostRecentPriceIsSale

Let look at the record to find the most recent data fields:

```json
{
            "mostRecentPriceAmount": 45.99,
            "mostRecentPriceNonSalesAmount": 45.99,
            "mostRecentPriceAvailability": "true",
            "mostRecentPriceCurrency": "USD",
            "mostRecentPriceColor": "Bose Black",
            "mostRecentPriceIsSale": "false",
            "mostRecentPriceDomain": "www.bestbuy.com",
            "mostRecentPriceSourceURL": "https://www.bestbuy.com/site/l1-pro8-pa-system-slip-cover-bose-black/6448584.p?skuId=6448584",
            "mostRecentPriceDate": "2023-12-05T16:31:29.398Z",
            "mostRecentPriceFirstDateSeen": "2023-10-27T07:22:34.425Z"
}
```

Now let's refine our search for any product under $45.

```json json
{
  "query": "brand:Bose AND mostRecentPriceAmount:<=45",
  "num_records":20
}
```

# Using the Enrichment API

You can also use Datafiniti's Enrichment API to pass in an entire file to enrich.  For more information on how to do this, refer to the [Enrichment API documentation](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-with-postman-and-json).

# Downloading a competing domain's entire product assortment

If you don't have an existing product data file, you can also just use Datafiniti to download the entire product assortment for a given e-commerce store.

Here's an example of that:

```json
{
  "query": "domains:www.bestbuy.com",
  "download": true,
  "format": "CSV"
}
```

This will download every product for ishop.gt into a CSV file.  You can also download in JSON format.

## Example files

Here are example bulk download files of our previous query:

* [Domain Search CSV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qVQfism6KsgydLF3QhUzab3NrUYao5JD/view?usp=share_link)
* [Domain Search JSON](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JttdyCEaBWT_rRgNgBNLXNQxTzSZz4D6/view?usp=share_link)

## Conclusion

With the knowledge of how to pull records from specific domains, you can compare the pricing of your or similar from a competing store/website.
