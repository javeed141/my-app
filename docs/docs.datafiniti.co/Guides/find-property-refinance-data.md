In this guide, we will walk you through common search criteria and how to leverage them for your investment and financial analysis purposes. Let's begin by exploring the possibilities!

# Searching for refinance data

There are several fields in our property data schema you can utilize to search for refinanced property data. All of these fields can be found in our [Property Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema). In this guide we will highlight using the following fields:

* taxExemptions
* title
* transactions
* trustDescription

## Tax exempted property

For this example, we will focus on querying for property with `taxExemptions` data. Let's say you want to search in the state of Texas for property with "Absolute Exemption". You can use the following query to find this data.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND taxExemptions:\"Absolute Exemption\" AND province:TX",
    "num_records":10
}
```

Being able to filter via `taxExemptions` will provide better insights into annual costs. Having this data allows more confidence before committing resources to an investment property.

## Title of property

For this example we will focus on data of titles of refinanced property. Let's say you want to gather the data for refinance titles in the Oklahoma area for pending or sold homes. You can using the following query to get that data.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND title:\"OWNER FINANCE\"",
    "num_records":10
}
```

## Transactions

For this example we will focus on the `transactions` of any refinance property. This will give you more details in the transaction record of the property recently refinanced. In this query we will be looking for the previous fields in this guide plus specifying that this property is a commercial property. Here is the query we would use:

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND title:* AND taxExemptions:* AND transactions:* AND propertyType:commercial",
    "num_records":10
}
```

> 📘 Transactions
>
> You can utilize the transactions field for more than just refiance data. Owner / seller data of the property can be had. Read [Find property comps from transaction data](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/find-property-comps-from-transaction-data) for more on using the `transactions` field.

## Trust descriptions

Lastly we can identify if a property has a trust associated with it. Lets say you want to compound the previous query but want to check the trust description. You can use the following query:

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND title:* AND taxExemptions:* AND transactions:* AND propertyType:commercial",
    "num_records":10
}
```
