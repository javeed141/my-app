# Search for smart phones

## Introduction

Datafiniti provides a robust collecting of pricing data for all sorts of products. Let's take a look at how to pull data that can be used for pricing and specs in one specific category, smart phones.

## Building a basic query for smart phones

By utilizing our `categories `field, we can query for smart phones. We will add a `prices `wildcard to guarantee that prices are displayed in the records found.

```json
{
  "query": "categories:\"phones\" AND prices:*",
  "num_records":1
}
```

## Filter by brand and name

Now let's add a brand and name filter to hone in on a specific type of smart phone.

```json
{
  "query": "brand:Google AND name:pixel AND categories:\"phones\" AND prices:*",
  "num_records":1
}
```

This will make sure the result records are for a google pixel smart phone and that a prices is listed.

## Filter by website sold from

```json
{
  "query": "brand:Google AND name:pixel AND categories:\"phones\" AND domains:amazon.com AND prices:*",
  "num_records":1
}
```

This will only display results that data was sourced from amazon.com.

## Filter by product color

Let's add a filter to search for black google pixels devices. This can be done by utilizing our `colors` fields.

```json
{
  "query": "brand:Google AND name:pixel AND categories:\"phones\" AND domains:amazon.com AND colors:black AND prices:*",
  "num_records":1
}
```

Typically color filters are helpful to find specific UPC, skus, or other unique identifiers.

## Example Records

Here is an example of a record of the final query:

The Tensor was created to give the Pixel 6 Pro enough power for Google to implement significant advances in AI and machine learning. Some real world examples include a re-engineered camera bar with AI capable of erasing objects and unblurring faces in an image, and voice recognition smart enough to detect accents and dialects to accurately translate up to 55 languages in real time, without requiring the internet. The increased power and AI intelligence of the Pixel 6 Pro are in addition to a host of additional advancements in more traditional aspects of smartphone technology. The Pixel 6 Pro's rear camera bar provides three cameras with larger pixels than previous generations, resulting in more detail and sharper night shots. The 6.7\" display auto adjusts the refresh rate up to 120 Hz, saving power while still providing smooth scrolling & gameplay. The body can handle the rigors of daily life with Gorilla Glass Victus cover & back glass and IP68 water and dust resistance. Inside and out, the Pixel 6 Pro reimagines what smartphones can be, giving you an experience that's even more personal than ever before.",

Instead of accurate and near instant fingerprint authentication when the reader was located on the rear of previous Pixels, the new underscreen implementation feels like Google just stuck it on to be like some of their competitors. Instead of giving their customers a streamlined experience and use tech that works, they decided to try to fix what wasn't broken. The result is a subpar user experience where fingerprint authentication works maybe 70% of the time, and when it does work, it takes almost as long as it does to simply type in an access code.",

I figured that the new pixel would have an even better camera experience for many reasons. However, I was super disappointed with the focusing on the new Pixel 6. Many of my photos were out of focus with very, very poor depth of field. My old pixel was never out of focus and had very deep depth of field. What a huge disappointment!! The rest of the features don't seem like much of an improvement either. I wish I would have gone with a different camera.",
