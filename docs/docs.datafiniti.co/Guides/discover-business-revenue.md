# Discover revenue of businesses

# Introduction

Datafiniti makes it easy to filter businesses by their reported annual revenue using the `revenueMin` and `revenueMax` fields. These fields help you find businesses that meet specific financial criteria—whether you're targeting small local shops or large enterprise brands.

In this guide, we’ll show you how to use these fields in your queries and explain how the revenue values are represented.

# Filtering by revenue

To search for businesses based on revenue, include either or both of the `revenueMin` and `revenueMax` fields in your query. These fields accept numerical values and are measured in USD (US dollars).

For example, let’s say you want to search for businesses with estimated annual revenue between $1 million and $10 million. You can build a query like this:

```json
{  
    "query": "revenueMin:[1000000 TO 10000000]",
    "num_records": 10 
}
```

If you only want to set a minimum or maximum range, you can use just one of the fields:

Minimum revenue only:

```json
{  
  "query": "revenueMin:[500000 TO *]",
	"num_records": 10  
}
```

Maximum revenue only:

```json
{  
  "query": "revenueMax:[* TO 2000000]",
	"num_records": 10  
}
```

<br />

## Finding Mid-Market Retail Businesses

Here’s a more specific example. Suppose you’re looking for retail businesses in Texas that make between $5 million and $20 million annually. You could use the following query:

```json
{  
  "query": "categories:Retail AND province:TX AND revenueMin:[5000000 TO 20000000]",  
  "format": "JSON",  
  "num_records": 10  
}
```

This will return up to 10 records for retail businesses in Texas that fall within that revenue range. The response will look something like this:

```json
{
    "num_found": 45,
    "total_cost": 10,
    "people_cost": 0,
    "property_cost": 0,
    "business_cost": 10,
    "product_cost": 0,

When I bought my car they made me feel confident this wasn't your average dealership and that I was taken care of, however after signing the fine line the attitude changed and just two months after buying my car I ran into a couple of problems they didn't fix for me. Chris was the only empathetic character I talked to in the place and if it weren't for him I don't know what I would have done because the Financial Manager is cold and offending.",

# Things to Keep in Mind

Revenue fields are not always available for every business. If a business doesn't have a revenue estimate, it won’t show up in queries that filter by `revenueMin` or `revenueMax`.

Revenue filters are especially useful when combined with fields like `categories`, `employeeCount`, and `yearIncorporated`.

Try It Out\
You can test your queries using the Business Data Search Tool. Just select “Advanced Search,” choose the fields you want, and try filtering by revenue range.
