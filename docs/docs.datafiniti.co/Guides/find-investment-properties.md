# Find investment properties

## Introduction

You can use the Datafiniti Property API to search for all kinds of properties that may match your investment criteria.  We have [hundreds of fields available in the data](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema), all of which are searchable.  It's just a matter of finding out the right combination of filters to meet your needs.  Let's explore some common search criteria!

## Residential homes for sale

When searching for specific property types in Datafiniti, you want to use the `propertyType` field.  There are a number of values for `propertyType` that correspond to residential homes.  The most commonly-used values are:

* `Single Family Dwelling`
* `Multi-Family Dwelling`
* `Condo`
* `Mobile Home`
* `Manufactured Home`

When we want to search for properties for sale, we use the `mostRecentStatus` field.

Here's how a simple search for recent for sale, single family homes looks:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\""
}
```

This query will return several properties.  Each property record will have some data that looks like this:

```json
"mostRecentPriceCurrency": "USD",
"mostRecentPriceDate": "2023-03-19T13:03:54.520Z",
"mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount": 529830,
"mostRecentSoldPriceAmount":520000,
```

This data shows the property in question is being sold for $529,830.

We can add more criteria to this to produce more targeted results.  Here's another example:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND city:(Austin OR Houston OR Dallas) AND province:TX"
}
```

This query adds the `city` and `province` fields to provide some geo-targeting.  You can also run [radial searches around a lat/long point](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/constructing-property-queries#geo-queries).

If you want to run price-based searches, try something like:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount:>300000 AND mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount:<500000 AND mostRecentPriceCurrency:USD"
}
```

This query searches for single family homes priced between $300,000 and $500,000.  [Learn more about range queries](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/constructing-property-queries#range-queries).

You can even use the `features` array to search on many, many more custom values, like so:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND {features.key:Heating AND features.value:Central}"
}
```

This will show you all for sale single family homes with central heating.

### Using residential view

You can also export / view your data via our residential view. The residential view will display select available fields in our [Property Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema) that is most relevant to residential `propertyType`. These `PropertyType`s are:

* Condo
* Multi Family Dwelling
* Single Family Dwelling
* Townhouse

An example:

```json
{
    "query":"propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND {features.key:Heating AND features.value:Central}",
    "num_records":1,
    "view": "residential"
}
```

## Rental properties

You can also use Datafiniti to find rental properties.  We'll use the `mostRecentStatus` field here as well.  Here's a simple search to start:

```json
{
  "query": "mostRecentStatus:Rental"
}
```

Of course, we may want to do something a little more complicated than that.  We probably also want to look for specific types of properties that are available to rent.  We can add the `propertyType` field to our query:

```json
{
  "query": "mostRecentStatus:Rental AND propertyType:\"Multi-Family Dwelling\""
}
```

This will show us all multi-family homes that have rental units available.  [Here are some other possible values for this field](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-property-fields#propertytype).

When you search for rental properties, you can check the `prices` array in the data you get back to see what the rental prices are.  Here's a truncated version of what that data will look like:

```json
"prices": [
   {
     "amountMax": 13428,
     "amountMin": 13428,
     "currency": "USD",
     "dateSeen": [
       "2022-05-11T02:42:00.000Z"
     ],
     "period": "Per Month",
     "pricePerSquareFoot": 4
   },
   {
     "amountMax": 11750,
     "amountMin": 11750,
     "currency": "USD",
     "dateSeen": [
       "2023-03-28T15:31:00.000Z"
     ],
     "period": "Per Month",
     "pricePerSquareFoot": 3.5
   }
 ],
```

The above data shows a property that was most recently renting for $11,750 per month.

## Commercial sites

Using Datafiniti to find commercial investment properties is very popular.  We'll use the `propertyType` field again, but this time with a new value:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:Commercial"
}
```

There are handful of commercial property types you may want to search on:

* `Commercial`
* `Industrial`
* `Retail`

## Land for sale

Finally, you may even be interested in searching for land.  Here's how to do this:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:Land"
}
```

You can run a more targeted search by adding more filters.  Searching for land that's of a certain size is a common use case.  Here's how to do that:

```json
{
  "query": "propertyType:Land AND lotSizeValue:>1 AND lotSizeUnit:acs"
}
```

This will search for land that's more than 1 acre in size.  [More info on searching on lot size](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-property-fields#floorsizeunit--lotsizeunit).
