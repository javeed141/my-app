# Identifying companies with employees targeted by cyberattacks

# Introduction

By providing a commercially-available database of personally-identifiable information (PII), Datafiniti's People Data can be used to protect companies against potential cyberattacks.  Let's learn how!

# Searching against a known target list

If your company provides cybersecurity protection, you likely have access to lists of known compromised individuals  These lists will likely contain name, email, and other identifiers for each person.  A list may look like:

```
Name, Email
Joe Curry, joe.curry@bellideas.com
Tina Harris, tharris@gmail.com
Luis Fiego, luis42@plymouth.edu
```

You can take information like this and use it to find matching individuals in our people database.  Here's how such a search might look:

```json
{
  "query": "firstName:Joe AND lastName:Curry AND emails:\"joe.curry@bellideas.com\""
}
```

If a matching record comes back, it will include the company that currently employs the individual.

```json
"businessName": "bell ideas",
```

# Aggregating data to identify compromised companies

As you match each person and find their current company, you can append the data to your original file:

```
Name, Email, Company
Joe Curry, joe.curry@bellideas.com, bell ideas
Tina Harris, tharris@gmail.com, quickpro
Luis Fiego, luis42@plymouth.edu, plymouth university
```

Once you've done so, you can count up the companies in your updated list to find which companies may be compromised more severely than others.

## Conclusion

With the knowledge of how to pull records with business-specific categories, you can now generate People Data that can be used to protect companies against potential cyberattacks.
