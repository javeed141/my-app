# 2019.8 - Data Release Log

# Overview

This month focused heavily on revisions to the schema and ensuring the conversions necessary for those revisions ran smoothly.

## Record Counts

The following are the updated record counts for each vertical:

* Business data increased by 3.1 million to 90.1 million
* People data increased by 0.1 million to 9.5 million
* Product data increased by 5.2 million to 129.3 million
* Property data increased by 7.2 million to 32.2 million

## New Sources

The following data types have received new sources:

* 3 Business data sources
* 1 Product data source

## Schema Changes

* We're still continuing our transition from `crawlResultFiles` to `crawlIDs`.
* The Product data received several new fields relating to upc's and ean's.  `upca`, `upce`, `ean13`, `ean8`, and `gtins` were all created in an effort to assist with searching for particular products.  The original fields of `upc` and `ean` will continue to be supported until they can be properly deprecated.
* `dateSeen` for several nested JSON object fields will be set to a single value depicting the latest date that object was seen by our crawlers.  In the future the name of this field will be changed to `dateUpdated`
* Business and Property data contain a new field called `geoLocation` which combines `latitude` and `longitude` into a single value.  This will be used in the future for queries involving relative distances.

## Fixes

* Categories and features were being populated with bad seller ranking data, removal is currently in-progress.
* The name field in our Product data would occasionally include "Details about" which is not part of the product.
* Updated 1 Business data source, 4 Property data sources, and 2 Product data sources
