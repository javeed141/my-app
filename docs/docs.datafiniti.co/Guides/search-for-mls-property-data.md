# Search for MLS Numbers or Download MLS Markets

## Introduction

Datafiniti's property data can be used to verify or enrich data that you have for existing properties. If you have an MLS number of a property but want more specific data about it, you can use Datafiniti to find out and analyze the property more.

>
> We recommend users combine their MLS number search with a province search for sometimes historical MLS data can be found that matches other MLSs in another state.

## Search using the MLS number

Since all properties have an MLS number you can search via our `mlsNumber` field.\
Here is an example of how to do that.

```json
{
  "query": "mlsNumber:09073511 AND province:IL",
  "num_records":1
}
```

This will pull the 1 record attached to this MLS number and specify the search to the state of Illinios.

## Using multiple MLS numbers

You can use OR operators in your query to search multiple MLS numbers at a time.

```json
{
  "query": "mlsNumber:(09073511 OR 09505465) AND province:IL",
	"num_records":2
}
```

## Adding more parameter to you MLS search

You can always add any field search from our property [schema](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema).

```json
{
	"query": "country:US AND people.title:owner AND prices.amountMin:>=500000 AND brokers.agent:* AND province:IL AND mlsNumber:(09073511 OR 09505465)",
"num_records":10
}
```

This query targets US and Illinois properties above or equal to 500000$. Along with must having a broker's agent and owner data.

> 🚧 Price & Integer Fields
>
> please note your field's data type when inputting your value in the search query. price will not accept commas (,) in the value.

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

# Search an Entire MLS Market

You can use the `mlsNumber` field and standard location fields (`country`, `province`, `postalCode`, `neighborhood`, etc.) to narrow or broaden your MLS data searches. Below are examples showing how to query different geographic levels — from nationwide to local neighborhoods.

## Target the Entire U.S. MLS Market

If you want to retrieve all MLS listings across the United States, you can simply search for records that contain an `mlsNumber` field. This will return any record tied to an MLS source.

Example — entire U.S. MLS data

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

<br />

You can add additional filters, as long as they reference valid [property data schema fields](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema). For instance, you might want to only download record that fit a particular price range or current status. You can filter by `mostRecentStatus` or by `mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount`.

Example — active listings (via `mostRecentStatus`) in the U.S.:

```json
{  
  "query": "country:US AND address:* AND mlsNumber:* AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\"",  
  "num_records": 10  
}
```

## Target an Entire State (Province)

By utilizing the `province` field you can search my state. Just be sure to convert to the 2 letter abbreviation. For this example we will search for MLS properties in California.

> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

```json
{  
  "query": "country:US AND province:CA AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",  
  "num_records": 10  
}
```

You could also filter by `city` (which is in the schema) in addition to state:

```json
{  
  "query": "country:US AND province:CA AND city:\"San Francisco\" AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",  
  "num_records": 10  
}
```

<br />

## Target Specific Postal Codes

The schema includes `postalCode`. Use that to restrict the scope.

Example — single postal code:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND province:TX AND postalCode:76544 AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

Example — multiple postal codes:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND province:TX AND postalCode:(76543 OR 76544 OR 76545) AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

## Target Specific Neighborhoods

The schema has a field named `neighborhoods` (a list of neighborhood names).

You can filter using that:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND province:NY AND neighborhoods:\"Upper East Side\" AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

If `neighborhoods` is not populated in your data, you can fall back to using geographic coordinates via `geoLocation`, or by using the latitude and longitude fields in range queries (they are part of the schema via geo indexing).

Example — geolocation range:

```json
{
  "query": "country:US AND geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND address:* AND mlsNumber:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```
