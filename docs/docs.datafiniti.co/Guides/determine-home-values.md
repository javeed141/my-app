# Determine home values

## Introduction

Many Datafiniti customers are interested in using our data to determine the value of a single home or the expected value of homes within a given area.  There are a couple ways to do this.

## Option #1 Using estimatedPrices to determine a home’s value

This method leverages the `estimatedPrices` field from Datafiniti’s property data to retrieve a home’s estimated value and compare it to recent sale prices of similar homes nearby from the previous example.

We will use this query for finding the Home’s Estimated Value:

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:*",
  "num_records": 10
}
```

Response Example:

```json
{
            "address": "6845 Avenue N Dr",
            "city": "Houston",
            "estimatedPrices": [
                {
                    "pricePerSquareFoot": 235.36,
                    "dateSeen": [
                        "2024-03-16T09:13:42.446Z"
                    ],
                    "sourceURLs": [
                        "https://www.movoto.com/houston-tx/6845-avenue-n-houston-tx-77011-403_60001740/"
                    ],
                    "domain": "www.movoto.com",
                    "firstDateSeen": "2024-03-16T09:13:42.446Z",
                    "lastDateSeen": "2024-03-16T09:13:42.446Z",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "amountMin": 287136,
                    "amountMax": 287136
                },
                {
                    "pricePerSquareFoot": 251.08,
                    "dateSeen": [
                        "2024-01-04T10:20:32.539Z"
                    ],
                    "sourceURLs": [
                        "https://www.movoto.com/houston-tx/6845-avenue-n-houston-tx-77011-403_60001740/"
                    ],
                    "domain": "www.movoto.com",
                    "firstDateSeen": "2024-01-04T10:20:32.539Z",
                    "lastDateSeen": "2024-01-04T10:20:32.539Z",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "amountMin": 306316,
                    "amountMax": 306316
                }
            ],
            "mostRecentStatus": "For Sale",
            "mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount": 319000,
            "province": "TX",
            "postalCode": "77011",
            "propertyType": "Single Family Dwelling",
            "sourceURLs": [
            ],
            "id": "SD2GrooB5p3ULnC0Gr8O"
        }
```

Now you can use the most recent estimated price for comparison of the estimated value to recent sales person. This will allow you to calculate the following:

* The average sale price of comparable homes.
* The target home’s estimated price (estimatedPrices) to the recent sales.
* Interpretation off the estimated price of the average sale price and if the listing price is over/undervalued.

In this case we can see for `"address": "6845 Avenue N Dr"` we can see the listed price as `319000`. However you can see the most recent estimated value from movoto is 306316. Meaning that you can see that the listing value is slightly overvalued, giving you the insight to bargain on this "for sale" property.

## Option 2: Download data for all homes in an area

You can also download data for all the homes in a given area.  Let's start with something simple:

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:*",
  ,
  "num_records": 10,
  "format": "JSON",
  "download": true
}
```

This query will match every single family home in the 78722 zip code that has been listed as for sale since January 1, 2023.  We can adjust the `dateUpdated` value to reflect any date range we want.

> 📘 Using credits
>
> Your "num\_records" sets your limit on how many credit to use. If your query is under the limit, Datafiniti will only charge property for the lower value. For more info on how to spend credits, you can read [How Credits Work](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/how-credits-work-api)

Let's say we don't want to do a zip code-based search.  We want to do a search around a lat/long point:

```json
{
	"query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:* AND geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND dateUpdated:[2023-01-01 TO *]"
}
```

This is similar to the previous query, but now it matches every property in a 10 mile radius around a single geo coordinate.  Longitude goes first, latitude goes second.

If we want to go a little further and only match properties that are within a certain price range, we do this:

```json
{
	"query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:* AND geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND dateUpdated:[2023-01-01 TO *] AND prices.amountMin:>=300000 AND prices.amountMin:<=500000"
}
```

This filters down the matching data further by restricting it to homes that have been listed between $300,000 - $500,000.

Finally, if we want to download the entire data set, we do this:

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:*AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND dateUpdated:[2023-01-01 TO *]",
	"download": true,
	"format": "CSV"    
}
```

We can adjust the parameters here to set format to `JSON`.  We can also restrict the number of records to download by passing in additional `num_records` field.

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

## Option 3: Find comparable homes to a single property

Let's say you have a property in mind and you want to use similar properties to determine the value of the home.

First off, if we don't have the features of the property in hand, we can try looking them up in Datafiniti.

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:*"
}
```

This will return something like:

```json

            "yearBuilt": 1946,
            "id": "AW1uPRo80x_BgD4eQLRL"
        }
```

From here, we can grab some fields that are most commonly used to compare properties:

```json
{
  "numBedroom": 2,
  "numBathroom": 3,
  "propertyType": "Single Family Dwelling",
  "yearBuilt": 2020,
  "geoLocation": "POINT (-97.770640 30.253540)"
}
```

There may be other fields, but let's keep it simple for now.  From here, we can automatically/programmatically build a search for comparable properties:

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:2 AND numBathroom:3 AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND yearBuilt:>=2018 AND yearBuilt:<=2022 AND postalCode:78722 AND estimatedPrices:* AND geoLocation:[-97.770640,30.253540,10,mi]",
  "num_records": 100,
  "format": "JSON",
  "download": true
}
```

This will find and download 100 similar properties in a 10 mile radius.  This information will contain pricing for each of these properties that will look like this:

```json
{
...
  "mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount": 415000,
  "mostRecentSaleListPriceDate": "2023-02-20T21:25:20.076Z",
...
}
```

You can take each of those prices, average them, and determine an expected value for the original property!
