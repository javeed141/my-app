# Business Data with Node.js and CSV

For this guide, we're going to assume you're interested in using Datafiniti's business data to do some marketing analysis on hotels.  Let's say you're a data scientist that's been tasked with the following:

1. Collect data on hotels.
2. Sort the data by state.
3. Find which states have the most hotels.

Your environment and data needs:

1. You're working with Node.js.
2. You want to work with CSV data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "1. Install the request module for Node"
}
[/block]

In your terminal, run the following to install the `request` module for Node:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "npm install request",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "2. Get your API token"
}
[/block]

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the [Datafiniti Web Portal (https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co), login, and click on your account name and the top-right.  From there, you'll see a link to the "My Account" page, which will take you to a page showing your token.  Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Copy the API token or store it somewhere you can easily reference.

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "For the rest of this document, we'll use `AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX` as a substitute example for your actual API token when showing example API calls."
}
[/block]

.

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "3. Run your first search"
}
[/block]

The first thing we'll do is do write some code that will run a test search.  This test search will give us a sense for what sort of data might be available.  Eventually we'll refine our search so that we get back the most relevant data.

Since we want hotels, let's try a simple search that will just give us online listings for hotels.

Write the following code in your code editor (replace the dummy API token with your real API token):

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "/*\n  Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Business Database for hotels.\n*/\nvar request = require('request');\n\n// Set your API parameters here.\nvar APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';\nvar view = 'businesses_all';\nvar format = 'JSON';\nvar query = encodeURIComponent('categories:hotels');\nvar records = '1';\nvar download = 'false';\n\n// Construct the API call.\nvar APICall = 'https://' + APIToken + ':@api.datafiniti.co/v3/data/businesses?'\n\t\t\t\t+ 'view=' + view\n\t\t\t\t+ '&q=' + query\n\t\t\t\t+ '&format=' + format\n\t\t\t\t+ '&records=' + records\n\t\t\t\t+ '&download=' + download;\n\n// Make the API call.\nrequest(\n  {\n    url : APICall\n  },\n  // Do something with the response.\n  function (error, response, body) {\n  \tconsole.log(body);\n  }\n);",
      "language": "javascript"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

You should get a response similar to this:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"estimated total\": 139666,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"address\": \"7030 Amin Dr\",\n      \"categories\": [\n        \"Hotels\"\n      ],\n      \"city\": \"Chattanooga\",\n      \"country\": \"US\",\n      \"dateAdded\": \"2016-11-04T23:50:14Z\",\n      \"dateUpdated\": \"2016-11-04T23:50:14Z\",\n      \"descriptions\": [\n        {\n          \"dateSeen\": [\n            \"2016-11-09T19:26:53Z\"\n          ],\n          \"sourceURLs\": [\n            \"http://www.hotels.com/ho141351/?locale=en_US&pos=HCOM_US\"\n          ],\n          \"value\": \"No-frills hotel in Hamilton Place with health club\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"Services\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"24-hour front desk, Dry cleaning/laundry service, Laundry facilities, Free newspapers in lobby\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"key\": \"Nearby Attractions\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"[In Hamilton Place, Hamilton Place Mall (1.1 mi / 1.7 km), Dragon Dreams Museum (2.7 mi / 4.4 km), Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum (3.6 mi / 5.8 km), Concord Golf Club (3.8 mi / 6 km), Brown Acres Golf Course (4 mi / 6.5 km)]\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"imageURLs\": [\n        \"https://exp.cdn-hotels.com/hotels/1000000/120000/117400/117332/117332_95_n.jpg\",\n        \"https://exp.cdn-hotels.com/hotels/1000000/120000/117400/117332/117332_107_n.jpg\"\n      ],\n      \"keys\": [\n        \"us/tn/chattanooga/7030amindr/1104338646\"\n      ],\n      \"latitude\": \"35.04281\",\n      \"longitude\": \"-85.158\",\n      \"name\": \"Mainstay Suites Chattanooga\",\n      \"numRoom\": 77,\n      \"phones\": [\n        \"8004916126\"\n      ],\n      \"postalCode\": \"37421\",\n      \"province\": \"TN\",\n      \"reviews\": [\n        {\n          \"date\": \"2013-11-11T00:00:00Z\",\n          \"dateAdded\": \"2016-11-04T23:50:14Z\",\n          \"dateSeen\": [\n            \"2016-11-06T00:00:00Z\",\n            \"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z\"\n          ],\n          \"rating\": 2,\n          \"sourceURLs\": [\n            \"https://www.hotels.com/hotel/141351/reviews%20/\"\n          ],\n          \"text\": \"Hotel was ok.

      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

Let's break down what the API call is all about:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "0-0": "`https://`",
    "h-0": "API Call Component",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "1-0": "`AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX:@`",
    "2-0": "`api.datafiniti.co`",
    "3-0": "`/v3`",
    "4-0": "`/data`",
    "5-0": "`/businesses`",
    "6-0": "`view=businesses_all`",
    "8-0": "`q=categories:hotels`",
    "0-1": "This is the communication protocol used by the API.  It's the same one used when you visit a secure website.",
    "1-1": "Your API token.  You're telling the API who you are so it can respond to your request.",
    "2-1": "The location of the API.",
    "3-1": "You're telling the API which version to use.  `v3` is our most recent and current API version.",
    "4-1": "You're telling the API you're interested in querying data.",
    "5-1": "Specifically, you're interested in business data.",
    "6-1": "The `view` tells the API in which fields you want your response.  `businesses_all` will show all available fields in a record.",
    "8-1": "The `q` tells the API what query you want to use.  In this case, you're telling the API you want to search by `categories`.  Any product that has `hotels` listed in its `categories` field will be returned.",
    "9-0": "`records=1`",
    "9-1": "The `records` tells the API how many records to return in the its response.  In this case, you just want to see 1 matching record.",
    "10-0": "`download=false`",
    "10-1": "The `download` tells the API if you want to initiate a download request or not. Setting it to `false` means you don't, so it will show the matching records immediately in the response.",
    "7-0": "`format=JSON`",
    "7-1": "The `format` tells the API which data format you want to see.  You can set it to `JSON` or `CSV`."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 11
}
[/block]

Now let's dive through the response the API returned:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "0-0": "`\"estimated_total\"`",
    "1-0": "`\"records\"`",
    "h-0": "Response Field",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-1": "The total number of available records in the database that match your query.  If you end up downloading the entire data set, this is how many records you'll use.",
    "1-1": "The first available matches to your query.  For most queries, you'll see 1 to 10 example records.  If there are no matches, this field will be empty.\n\nWithin each record returned, you'll see multiple fields shown.  This is the data for each record."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 2
}
[/block]

Within the `records` field, you'll see a single business returned with multiple fields and their values associated with that business.  The JSON response will show all fields that have a value.  It won't show any fields that don't have a value.

Each business record will have multiple fields associated with it.  You can see a full list of available fields in our [Business Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/business-data-schema).

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "4. Refine your search"
}
[/block]

If you think about the original query we made, you'll realize we didn't really specify which geography we're interested in.  Since we only want US hotels, we should narrow our search appropriately.

We'll need to refine our search to make sure we're only getting hotels.  To do that, we can add additional filters to the `q` parameter to narrow down the results.  For example:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "/*\n  Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Business Database for hotels,\n  with some refinements to the query to get more relevant results.\n*/\nvar request = require('request');\n\n// Set your API parameters here.\nvar APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';\nvar view = 'businesses_all';\nvar format = 'JSON';\nvar query = encodeURIComponent('categories:hotels AND country:US');\nvar records = '10';\nvar download = 'false';\n\n// Construct the API call.\nvar APICall = 'https://' + APIToken + ':@api.datafiniti.co/v3/data/businesses?'\n\t\t\t\t+ 'view=' + view\n\t\t\t\t+ '&q=' + query\n\t\t\t\t+ '&format=' + format\n\t\t\t\t+ '&records=' + records\n\t\t\t\t+ '&download=' + download;\n\n// Make the API call.\nrequest(\n  {\n    url : APICall\n  },\n  // Do something with the response.\n  function (error, response, body) {\n  \tconsole.log(body);\n  }\n);",
      "language": "javascript"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

This query is different in a couple ways:

1. It adds ` AND country:US` to narrow down results to just US hotels.
2. It changes `records=1` to `records=10` so we can look at more sample matches.

Datafiniti lets you construct very refined boolean queries.  If you wanted to do more complicated searches, you could OR operations, negation, and more.

You can run the Node.js code above to see the difference in the results.

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "5. Initiate a full download of the data"
}
[/block]

Once we like what we see from the sample matches, it's time to download the entire data set!  To do this, we're going to update our code a fair bit (an explanation follows):

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "var request = require('request');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n// Set your API parameters here.\nvar APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';\nvar view = 'businesses_all';\nvar format = 'csv';\nvar query = encodeURIComponent('categories:hotels AND country:US');\nvar records = '10';\nvar download = 'true';\n\n// Construct the API call.\nvar APICall = 'https://' + APIToken + ':@api.datafiniti.co/v3/data/businesses?'\n\t\t\t\t+ 'view=' + view\n\t\t\t\t+ '&q=' + query\n\t\t\t\t+ '&format=' + format\n//\t\t\t+ '&records=' + records\n\t\t\t\t+ '&download=' + download;\n\n// A function to check if a download request has completed\nfunction checkDownloadUntilComplete(options, callback) {\n\tvar downloadRequestAPICall = 'https://' + APIToken + ':@api.datafiniti.co/v3/requests/' + options.requestID;\n\n\trequest({url : downloadRequestAPICall}, function(error, response, body) {\n\t\tvar downloadRequestResponse = JSON.parse(body);\n\t\tif (downloadRequestResponse[0].status !== 'COMPLETED') {\n\t\t\t// NEED A SLEEP FUNCTION HERE!\n\t\t\tconsole.log('Checking on status: ' + downloadRequestAPICall);\n\t\t\tcheckDownloadUntilComplete(options, callback);\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcallback(null, downloadRequestResponse);\n\t\t}\n\t});\n}\n\n// Initiate the download request.\nrequest({url : APICall}, function (error, response, body) {\n  \tvar downloadResponse = JSON.parse(body);\n  \tvar requestID = downloadResponse[0].id;\n\n  \t// Check on status of the download request.\n  \tcheckDownloadUntilComplete ({requestID : requestID}, function (error, response) {\n  \t\tvar resultsAPICall = 'https://' + APIToken + ':@api.datafiniti.co/v3/results/' + requestID;\n\n  \t\t// Once the download is complete, get all the links to result files and write those to local files.\n  \t\trequest({url : resultsAPICall}, function(error, response, body) {\n\t\t\tvar resultsResponse = JSON.parse(body);\n\t\t\tfor (var i = 0; i < resultsResponse.length; i++) {\n\t\t\t\tvar file = fs.createWriteStream(requestID + '_' + i + '.' + format);\n\t\t\t\trequest(resultsResponse[i].url).pipe(file);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n  \t});\n  }\n);",
      "language": "javascript"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

A few things to pay attention to in the above code:

1. We changed `format=JSON` to `format=CSV`.  We'll want to view the files in CSV format, so it will be easier to look at.
2. We removed `&records=10`.
3. We changed `businesses_all` to `businesses_all_nested`.  This will nest fields like categories and features into a single cell (instead splitting them across multiple rows and columns).
4. We changed `download=false` to `download=true`.

Since we've handled multiple steps of the download process in this code, we won't go into the details here, but we do recommend you familiarize yourself with those steps.  Checking them out in our [Business Data with Web Browser and CSV Guide](https://datafiniti-api.readme.io/docs/business-data-with-web-browser-csv) will be helpful.

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "6. Open the result file(s) in Excel"
}
[/block]

The download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.  Open one of those files in Excel.  It will look something like:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/19e9515-hotel_sample.jpg",
        "hotel_sample.jpg",
        1600,
        822,
        "#214768"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "7. Analyze the results"
}
[/block]

Using Excel, we can easily count the total number of hotels on a state-by-state basis.  The `province` column gives us where each hotel is located, so we can use it to tally up the numbers.
