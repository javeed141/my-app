# Discover when clients sell their homes

## Introduction

Datafiniti Property Data can help you identify when your own clients are selling or have recently sold their homes.  You may be able to use this information to run certain kinds of sales or marketing campaigns.  E.g., someone selling their home via a MLS network may be in need of a home loan to purchase a new property.  They may need moving or home inspection services.  Here's how you can set up a process to track and follow up with these folks.

## Step 1: Provide a list of your clients' addresses

If you have a list of your clients, hopefully you also have a list of their home addresses.  It might look something like this:

```text
Address, City, State, Zip
------------------------
1023 Jollyville Rd, Austin, TX, 78703
451 Webber Ln, Austin, TX, 78721
5063 Anderson Cir, Houston, TX 77079
```

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

## Step 2: Build a script that checks the current status of each address

Build a small script (in the programming language of your choice) that reads each line from the above file and searches for the property on Datafiniti.  This script would make a request to the property search endpoint and look something like this:

```json
{
	"query": "address:\"1023 Jollyville Rd\" AND city:Austin AND province:TX AND postalCode:78703 AND dateUpdated:[2023-03-28 TO *]"
}
```

We're adding a `dateUpdated` filter at the end so that you're only checking for recently updated records.  Each day, the script would automatically update the date value used.

If there's a match, it will look something like this:

```json
{
    "num_found": 1,
    "total_cost": 1,
    "records": [
        {
            "address": "1023 Jollyville Rd",
            "city": "Austin",
            "country": "US",
            "dateAdded": "2020-04-23T16:54:17Z",
            "dateUpdated": "2023-03-28T12:12:03Z",
            "mostRecentStatus": "For Sale",
            "mostRecentStatusDate": "2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z",
            "mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen": "2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z",
            "mlsNumber": "6293857",
            "propertyType": "Single Family Dwelling",
            "province": "TX",
            "id": "AXGn9iLB2qQdVO6N5QwH"
        }
    ]
}
```

In reality, the record will have much more data, but we're just truncating it here to make it easier to view.  The important fields are `mostRecentStatus` and `mostRecentStatusDate`.  These tell you that the property has a recently updated status and (in this case) is now for sale.

> 📘 Data Freshness Notice – Owner & Transaction Data
>
> Homeowner contact details and transaction records are typically available within 2 weeks after a property is marked as sold. This brief processing window allows us to validate, normalize, and match deed and ownership updates to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives.

Using this information, your script might update each of the addresses in your client list like so:

```text
Address, City, State, Zip, Status, Status Date
----------------------------------------------
1023 Jollyville Rd, Austin, TX, 78703, For Sale, 2023-03-28
451 Webber Ln, Austin, TX, 78721, For Sale, 2023-03-28
5063 Anderson Cir, Houston, TX 77079, No Change, N/A
```

## Step 3: Use the updated client file to run a campaign

Now with the updated status information in hand, you can integrate the file into your own CRM to run sales or marketing campaigns!
