# Search on property statuses

## Introduction

Datafiniti's property data can be used to verify or enrich data that you have for existing properties. If you have an area of property but want more specific data about its statuses on the market, you can use the following guide as a starting point.

> 📘 Status Types
>
> We recommend users view our possible status type values page [here ](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-property-fields)to determine the exact string to search property data for.

## Search "for sale" property

Let's say you are looking for single-family dwelling for sale in Sacramento, California.\
Here is an example of how to do that.

```json
{
    "query": "country:US AND province:CA AND city:sacramento AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\"",
	"num_records":1
}
```

This will pull the 1 record for a single-family dwelling for sale in Sacramento, California.

## Search for houses sold in the last 30 days

You can use our property status / mostRecentStatus data fields to find single-family dwelling housing sold in the last 30 days. Building off the last example, let's search for sold property in the last 30 days.

```json
{
	"query":"country:US AND province:CA AND city:sacramento AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND (mostRecentStatus:\"Sold\" AND mostRecentSoldPriceDate:[2023-02-01 TO 2023-03-01])",
	"num_records":2
}
```

This will pull 2 records for sold SFD properties in the Sacramento Area.

> 📘 mostRecentStatus vs statusHistory
>
> Please note that **mostRecentStatus** is a field that frequently is updated. For historical status data please use/search via the **statusHistory** field.

## Search for specific address

You can search for the status of a specific address by using the following query.

```json
{
	"query": "address:\"3900 Eventide Ave\" AND city:(\"Sacramento\") AND province:(\"CA\") AND country:\"US\" AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\"" 
}
```

If your specific address is found with the mostRecentStatus you are searching for, you can guarantee the property's is correct.

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

## Search for historical data of sold commercial property

You can always add any field search from our property [schema](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema).

```json
{
	"query": "country:US AND province:CA AND city:sacramento AND propertyType:\"Single Family Dwelling\" AND statusHistory.type:Sale",
	"num_records":10
}
```

This will provide 10 records of single family dwellings that have been sold in the Sacramento area.

## Search for off market / delisted properties

In this example we are going to search for one property that has been delisted or labelled as off-market.

```json json
{
 	"query":"mostRecentStatus:(\"Off Market\" OR Delisted*) OR statusHistory.type:Delisted* AND country:US AND province:CA AND mostRecentStatusDate:[2023-03-28 TO *]",
	"num_records":1
}
```

> 🚧 Off Market vs Delisted
>
> Datafiniti uses Off Market for generally stating that the property is off the market. Delisted will be post fixed with the specific reason why the property is off the market.

## Search for recently changed property status

Let's say that you want to find the most recent "For Sale" property as it hits the market. You can utilize the  `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen `for this use case. We will use the following API call to search for newly listed "For Sale" in Sacramento, California. Note that you may have to update the mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen to your current date

```json
{
  	"query":"mostRecentStatus:(\"For Sale\") AND city:Sacramento AND country:US AND province:CA AND mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen:[2023-11-28 TO *]",
    "num_records":10
}
```

> 📘 mostRecentStatusDate vs mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen
>
> `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen` is the date for the 1st time Datafiniti scrape and found the status change. `mostRecentStatusDate `is the status date listed by the source listing. Because of this distinguished difference you may see `mostRecentStatusDate` older than `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen`.

## Example Records

Here are example bulk download files of our previous query:

* [Delisted Sacramento, CA CSV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VvCBRc9PACAo-GHPyyP2iGi7SkT76dAZ/view?usp=share_link)
* [Delisted Sacramento, CA Json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cL8HU5hHws5J9WnkOkG-shSCkvqqVQ2/view?usp=share_link)

### Conclusion

With the tools to target specific areas of the property, you now have the capability to find delisted in any area you choose.
