# Collect HOA fee data for a property

# Introduction

HOA fees can be an important variable in analyzing the risk factors for real estate investment portfolios.  Datafiniti can help you collect this data at scale and feed it into any risk analysis you may be performing

# Searching for HOA fees

Fees are a top-level field within the Datafiniti property schema.  You can search for any property with associated fees data by doing something like:

```json
{
  "query": "fees.type:HOA"
}
```

Any returned fees data will look something like:

```json
 "fees": [
   {
     "amountMax": 473,
     "amountMin": 473,
     "currency": "USD",
     "dateSeen": [
       "2023-03-08T02:11:00.000Z",
       "2023-03-27T13:15:00.000Z",
       "2023-03-28T17:28:00.000Z",
       "2023-02-18T04:42:00.000Z"
     ],
     "type": "HOA"
   },
   {
     "amountMax": 320,
     "amountMin": 320,
     "currency": "USD",
     "dateSeen": [
       "2020-11-05T02:29:00.000Z",
       "2020-11-07T02:00:00.000Z"
     ],
     "type": "HOA"
