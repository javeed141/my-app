# 2026.02 - Data Release Log

At Datafiniti, we’re always working to make our data more accurate and easier to use at scale. This February, we’re excited to share an important update to our **Property Data schema**—one that improves how property status changes are represented over time.

***

## New Field Announcement: `statusHistory`

We’ve introduced a new field, **`statusHistory`**, to the Property Data schema.

This field provides a clear, chronological view of a property’s status over time, allowing you to track transitions such as *for-sale listings* and *off-market events* with greater precision and context. Since we have removed rental statuses from this array, we wanted to create a historical field that better reflects how status data appears over time.

Each `statusHistory` entry includes:

* **Date** — The date the status change occurred
* **DateSeen** — The date Datafiniti observed the status change
* **sourceURLs** — The source URL associated with the status
* **Type** — The type of sales listing associated with the status (available status types can be found in the documentation)

*Example of code*

This enhancement is especially valuable for customers building:

* Market trend analyses
* Time-based property lifecycle models
* Investment, off-market insights, or sales intelligence workflows

You can review the updated schema documentation here:

## Deprecation Notice: Legacy `statuses` Fields

As part of this improvement, we are beginning the deprecation of legacy `statuses` fields in favor of **`statusHistory`**.

### Why the change?

* The previous `statuses` structure needed more reliable date tracking and historical context
* The split of rental statuses and sale/off-market statuses left the `statuses` field obsolete
* `statusHistory` provides a single, unified, and future-proof approach

### What this means for you:

* Existing fields will continue to work for now
* We strongly recommend updating your workflows to use `statusHistory`
* Future schema updates will prioritize `statusHistory` as the source of truth
* We’ll provide ample notice before any breaking changes occur

## Coming This Year

We have several innovative developments on our roadmap this year, including:

### Improved Autotrace Feature

Our Autotrace feature allows customers to perform skip traces on property records and match homeowner information to them. While this feature is functional today, it’s not as usable or accessible as we’d like.

Later this year, we’ll be redesigning Autotrace to deliver a more intuitive experience—reducing the process to a **single API call** to retrieve accurate contact information for property owners.

### Connecting Datafiniti to AI Platforms

A major focus this year is enabling direct integration between Datafiniti and AI platforms. To support this, we’ll be investing in making Datafiniti more **AI-friendly**, including:

* MCP integration
* More detailed and structured code examples in our documentation
* Additional tutorials designed to be easily understood by LLMs

All of this work will help you integrate Datafiniti into your workflows with just a few prompts.
