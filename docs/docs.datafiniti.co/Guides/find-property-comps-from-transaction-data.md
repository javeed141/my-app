# Find property comps from transaction data

# Introduction

Determining where the market is at can be done with relative ease.  Datafiniti can provide current and historical rental rates for any given property. Utilizing our `transactions `field we can look up prices that property sold for.

# Find a property with transaction data

To search for a specific property with a transaction history, start by searching for that property's address or area and add a transaction price wildcard, like so:

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND province:FL AND transactions.price:*",
    "num_records":1
}
```

This will provide a record result that guarantees a price listed for the sold listing of a property.

```json
"transactions": [
                {
                    "saleDate": "2022-12-20T00:00:00.000Z",
                    "documentType": "Warranty Deed",
                    "price": 17300,
                    "sellerLastName": "Dl Investors 1 Llc",
                    "buyerFirstName": "xxxxx",
                    "buyerLastName": "xxxxxx",
                    "loanType": "Conventional",
                    "parcelNumber": "09-44-25-15-0000D.0190",
                    "contactOwnerMailAddressFull": "38 PRIEST ST"
                }
            ],
```

## Find property transaction between a date range

Now let say you need to pull these properties that were sold in the last year. You can use the `transactions.saleDate` to search via a range statement search.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND province:FL AND transactions.price:* AND transactions.saleDate:[2023-01-01 TO 2024-01-01]",
    "num_records":1
}
```

# Compare comps of a specific area

You can utilize this data to compare comps in a focus area.

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND province:FL AND transactions.price:* AND postalCode:33905",
    "num_records":10
}
```

This will provide 10 records with transaction prices of the sold property.
