# Product Data with Python

For this guide, we're going to assume the following you're interested in using Datafiniti's product data to analyze trends in the women's luxury shoe market.  Let's say you're a data scientist that's been tasked with the following:

1. Collect pricing data on women's luxury shoes from multiple online retailers.
2. Sort the data by brand.
3. Determine the average price of each brand.

**Your environment and data needs:**

1. You're working with Python.
2. You want to work with CSV or JSON data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

> 🚧 Python Version
>
> Note that we are using Python 3 for the examples below. Any 3.x version should work for this guide. You can always check your version via your python terminal via `python --version`.

## 1. Install the requests module for Python

In your terminal, run the following to install the `requests` module for Python:

```shell
pip3 install requests
```

## 2. Get your API token

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the [Datafiniti Web Portal (https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings/api), login, and click on your "Copy Token". Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Store it somewhere you can easily reference.

> 🚧 API token reset
>
> For security reasons, your API token will be automatically changed whenever you change your password.

> 📘 Token Reference
>
> For the rest of this document, we'll use `AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX` as a substitute example for your actual API token when showing example API calls.

## 3. Run your first search

The first thing we'll do is do write some code that will run a test search.  This test search will give us a sense for what sort of data might be available.  Eventually we'll refine our search so that we get back the most relevant data.

Since we want hotels, let's try a simple search that will just give us online listings for hotels.

Write the following code in your code editor (replace the dummy API token with your real API token):

```python
# Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Product Database.
import requests
import urllib.parse
import json

# Set your API parameters here.
API_token = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX'
#format = 'CSV'
format = 'JSON'
query = 'categories:shoes'
num_records = 1
download = False

request_headers = {
	'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + API_token,
	'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
request_data = {
    'query': query,
    'format': format,
    'num_records': num_records,
    'download': download
}

# Make the API call.
r = requests.post('https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/products/search',json=request_data,headers=request_headers);

# Do something with the response.
if r.status_code == 200:
	print(r.content)
else:
	print('Request failed')
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "num_found": 884885,
  "total_cost": 1,
  "records": [
    {
      "asins": [
        "B010XYTFM6"

      "brand": "inktastic",

    }
  ]
}
```

Let's break down each of the parameters we sent in our request:

| API Call Component            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"query": "categories:shoes"` | `query` tells the API what query you want to use.  In this case, you're telling the API you want to search by `categories`.  Any product that has `shoes` listed in its `categories` field will be returned. |
| `"num_records": 1`            | `num_records` tells the API how many records to return in its response.  In this case, you just want to see 1 matching record.                                                                               |
| `"format":"xxxx"`             | `"format"` tells the API what format to output the data in the response. Can be either `CSV` or `JSON`.                                                                                                      |

Now let's dive through the response the API returned:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Response Field",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "`\"num_found\"`",
    "0-1": "The total number of available records in the database that match your query.  If you end up downloading the entire data set, this is how many records you'll use.",
    "1-0": "`\"total_cost\"`",
    "1-1": "The number of credits this request has cost you.  Product records only cost 1 credit per record.",
    "2-0": "`\"records\"`",
    "2-1": "The first available matches to your query. If there are no matches, this field will be empty.  \nWithin each record returned, you'll see multiple fields shown.  This is the data for each record."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 3,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

Within the `records` field, you'll see a single product returned with multiple fields and the values associated with that product.  The JSON response will show all fields that have a value.  It won't show any fields that don't have a value.

Each product record will have multiple fields associated with it.  You can see a full list of available fields in our [Product Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-schema).

## 4. Refine your search

If you take a look at the sample record shown above, you'll notice that it's not actually a pair of shoes.  It's actually a shirt.  It was returned as a match because its category keywords included `Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry`.  If we downloaded all matching records, we would find several products that really are shoes, but we'd also find other products like this one, which aren't.

We'll need to refine our search to make sure we're only getting shoes.  Modify your code to look like this:

```python
# Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Product Database.
import requests
import urllib.parse
import json

# Set your API parameters here.
API_token = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX'
#format = 'CSV'
format = 'JSON'
query = 'categories:shoes AND -categories:shirts AND categories:women AND (brand:* OR manufacturer:*) AND prices:*'
num_records = 10
download = False

request_headers = {
	'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + API_token,
	'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
request_data = {
    'query': query,
    'format': format,
    'num_records': num_records,
    'download': download
}

# Make the API call.
r = requests.post('https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/products/search',json=request_data,headers=request_headers);

# Do something with the response.
if r.status_code == 200:
	print(r.content)
else:
	print('Request failed')
```

This code is different in a couple ways:

1. It uses ` AND -categories:shirts` to filter out any products that might be shirts. Note the `-` in front of `categories`.
2. It adds ` AND categories:women` to narrow down results to just products for women. (We were interested in just women's shoes.)
3. It adds `  AND (brand:* OR manufacturer:*)`.  This ensures the `brand` or `manufacturer` field is filled out in all the records I request.  We call the `*` a "wildcard" value.  Matching against a wildcard is a useful way to ensure the fields you're searching aren't empty.
4. It adds ` AND prices:*`.  Again, matching against a wildcard here means we're sure to only get products that have pricing information.
5. It changes `records=1` to `records=10` so we can look at more sample matches.

Notice how Datafiniti lets you construct very refined boolean queries.  In the API call above, we're using a mix of `AND` and `OR` to get exactly what we want.

If you would like to narrow your search to just exact matches you can place the search term in quotation marks.

```python
# Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Product Database.
import requests
import urllib.parse
import json

# Set your API parameters here.
API_token = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX'
#format = 'CSV'
format = 'JSON'
query = 'name:"Apple Iphone 10"'
num_records = 10
download = False

request_headers = {
	'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + API_token,
	'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
request_data = {
    'query': query,
    'format': format,
    'num_records': num_records,
    'download': download
}

# Make the API call.
r = requests.post('https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/products/search',json=request_data,headers=request_headers);

# Do something with the response.
if r.status_code == 200:
	print(r.content)
else:
	print('Request failed')
```

The above query will only return products with the exact name of Apple Iphone 10.

## 5. Initiate a download of the data

Once we like what we see from the sample matches, it's time to download a larger data set!  To do this, we're going to update our code a fair bit (an explanation follows):

```python
# Illustrates an API call to Datafiniti's Product Database.
import requests
import urllib.parse
import json
import time

# Set your API parameters here.
API_token = 'AAAXXXXXXXX'
format = 'JSON'
query = 'categories:shoes AND -categories:shirts AND categories:women AND (brand:* OR manufacturer:*) AND prices:*'
num_records = 50
download = True

request_headers = {
	'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + API_token,
	'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
request_data = {
    'query': query,
    'format': format,
    'num_records': num_records,
    'download': download
}

# Make the API call.
r = requests.post('https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/products/search',json=request_data,headers=request_headers);

# Do something with the response.
if r.status_code == 200:
	request_response = r.json()
	print(request_response)

	# Keep checking the request status until the download has completed
	download_id = request_response['id']
	download_status = request_response['status']

	while (download_status != 'completed'):
		time.sleep(5)
		download_r = requests.get('https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/downloads/' + str(download_id),headers=request_headers);
		download_response = download_r.json()
		download_status = download_response['status']
		print('Records downloaded: ' + str(download_response['num_downloaded']))

	# Once the download has completed, get the list of links to the result files and download each file
	if download_status == 'completed':
		result_list = download_response['results']
		i = 1;
		for result in result_list:
			filename = str(download_id) + '_' + str(i) + '.' + format
			urllib.request.urlretrieve(result,filename)
			print('File: ' + str(i) + ' out of ' + str(len(result_list)) + ' saved: ' + filename)
			i += 1

else:
	print('Request failed')
	print(r)
```

A few things to pay attention to in the above code:

1. We changed `num_records` from `10` to `50`.  This will download the first 50 matching records.  If we wanted to download all matching records, we would remove `num_records`. `num_records` will tell the API to default to all available records.
2. We changed `download` from `false` to `true`.

> 🚧 Num\_records
>
> If num\_records is not specified, ALL of the records matching the query will be downloaded.

Since we've handled multiple steps of the download process in this code, we won't go into the details here, but we do recommend you familiarize yourself with those steps.  Checking them out in our [Product Data with Postman and JSON](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-with-postman-json) guide.

## 6. Parse the JSON data

### Open the result file(s) in Excel

The download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.  Open one of those files in Excel.  It will look something like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8b08d6f8ae5cdf1c77c8c56b6da899a6c006ce27fb76ddfb795aaf0a4f3b50b-image.png)

### Parse the JSON data

The download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.

> 📘 JSON format
>
> The JSON data will actually be a text file, instead of a single JSON object. Each line in the text file is a JSON object. We format the data this way because most programming languages won't handle parsing the entire data set as a JSON object with their standard system calls very well.

We'll need to parse the file into an array of JSON objects. We can use code similar to this to handle the parsing:

```python
import json

# Set the location of your file here
filename = 'xxxx_x.txt'

records = []

with open(filename) as myFile:
	for line in myFile:
		records.append(json.loads(line))

for record in records:
	# Edit these lines to do more with the data
	print json.dumps(record, indent=4, sort_keys=True)
```

You can edit the code in the `for` loop above to do whatever you'd like with the data, such as store the data in a database, write it out to your console, etc.
