# Coming Soon

## Autotrace property data - new feature

We are thrilled to announce autotrace as a new feature to our property data search API. Allowing you to combine data from both people data and property data. This API call uses the regular property search endpoint with minor differences, notably the auto\_trace parameter and the specific view for property records. This will allow you to directly pull property with newly added home owner contact information with one API call. To learn more about autotrace, please read here.

## Auto trace property searches via the portal

This new feature will allow you to pull more detailed home owner information from our people database. This will allow you to pull people and property data via the detailed view in the property data. Stay tuned to find out more information.
