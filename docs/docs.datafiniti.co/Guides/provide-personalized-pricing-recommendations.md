You can use any of the above fields when searching on prices.

# Searching on prices

Let's learn how to search on prices in different ways.

We can start with a very basic search that return any products in a given category with a price:

```json
{
  "query": "categories:electronics AND prices:*
}
```

If we want to search for products within a certain price range, we can do this, which will return all products priced between $100 and $200.

```json
{
  "query": "categories:electronics AND {prices.amountMin:>=100 AND prices.currency:USD} AND {prices.amountMin:<=200 AND prices.currency:USD}"
}
```

If we want to find products that are recently on sale, we can do this, which will return all products on sale since April 1, 2023:

```json
{
  "query": "categories:electronics AND {prices.isSale AND prices.dateSeen:[2023-04-01 TO *]}"
}
```

If we want to make sure we return products that have a warranty:

```json
{
  "query": "categories:electronics AND prices.warranty:*
}
```

You can use any number of combination of fields to find exactly the pricing data you want.  With this information, you can provide information back to customers that gives them the exact insight they need.

## Conclusion

With the knowledge of how to pull records with product pricing, you can provide users or customers with information on which products match their budgets.
