# Search via street address

## Introduction

Datafiniti's business data can be used to enrich, search, or verify almost any business you want. In this example we will show you how to use Datafiniti business search API to query for specific addresses.

## Search using Street Address

Since street addresses can be broken down into many parts, we will query based on each individual part. You can determine your fields to search via our [Business Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/business-data-schema). We will query based on each part at the following address:

* 700 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78701

```json
{
  "query": "address:\"700 East 6th St\" AND city:Austin AND province:TX",
  "num_records":1
}
```

> 🚧 Exact Matches
>
> Notice that in the address field, we use " " for searching what exactly the address string is. This will guarantee that we are not fuzzy matching and only looking for the specific address string.

> 📘 Street Name Abbreviations
>
> Datafiniti runs an address normalization process across our entire business and business database. We normalize our addresses to a 2-character abbreviation USPS standard. You can find out more about this process [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data).

## Search for Unit

Sometimes your business can be a unit, suite, etc that is designated by an unit/suite number. In this example we will show how to query for the following address:

* 4613 S Congress Avenue, Austin, TX 78722, unit k

```json
{
  "query": "address:\"4613 S Congress Ave unit k\" AND city:Austin AND province:TX",
  "num_records":1
}
```

Notice that we are using the exact match to how the source of the address displays the unit name.

## Search for Suite Address

Sometimes your business can be a unit, suite, etc that is designated by an unit/suite number. In this example we will show how to query for the following address:

* 8701 W Parmer Ln, Austin, TX 78745, Suite 2128

```json
{
  "query": "address:\"8701 W Parmer Ln Suite 2128\" AND city:Austin AND province:TX",
  "num_records":1
}
```

> 🚧 Matching Suite/Unit Addresses
>
> Please note that we do normalize partially the suite/unit of the address depending on the source of the data. Since this address is separated from the suite number, we stitch the two string together to form the address in the record.

You can always add any field search from our business [schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-people-fields).
