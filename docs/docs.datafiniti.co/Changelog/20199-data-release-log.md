## Schema Changes

* Property data receives a new field `mostRecentStatusDate` and the accompanying nested field value `statuses.date` which describes the date a status took place.
* `imageURLs` will only contain the most recent set of links from a particular domain versus continuing to compile new links as they are gathered.
* We're still continuing our transition from `crawlResultFiles` to `crawlIDs`, Product data is the remaining data source being transitioned.
* `geoLocation` continues to be implemented across our database for Business and Property data
* `dateSeen` to a single value for many nested JSON object fields continues to be transitioned for all data types.
* The new UPC and EAN fields along with the container field called `gtins` continues to be implemented for all Product data.
