# Count

Our count feature is an alternative way for testing the people search API search request. You can set your `num_records` to 0 in your people search query. This is will only return the `num_found` of the query and will cost 0 credits to search. Lastly you are not charged people data credits for this. Try it out

```json
{
  "query": "country:US",
  "num_records":0
}
```

Expected response:

```json
{
    "num_found": 22886573
}
```

From this result we can tell that we have a total of 22886573 with the search parameters. This knowledge is great for testing your query syntax, seeing expect results before pulling real data, or sanity checking value from previous searches.
