# Contact new home owners

## Introduction

Datafiniti's property data can be used to generate lead lists for individuals or homes that have just purchased a new home. You can use our advanced query syntax to generate a targeted lists.

## Searching for recently sold single-family homes

Many property listings include information on when a property was sold via online listing or MLS networks. We will utilize the syntax next to find a list of properties recently sold.

```json
{
  "query":"country:US AND transactions.buyerFirstName:* AND transactions.saleDate:[2023-01-01 TO *]",
  "num_records":10
}
```

You may sub out the date range of `saleDate `to whatever time period that pertains to your use case.

This query is a little complex, so let's explain what's happening:

* We're using a `buyerFirstName`wildcard to guarantee that the home owner is their.
* `Transactions.saleDate`with show us only records with the start date until \*. (current date)

## Eliminating newly built houses from your search

We can also use the `yearBuilt` field to find older homes:

```json
{
  "query":"country:US AND transactions.buyerFirstName:* AND transactions.saleDate:[2023-01-01 TO *] AND yearBuilt:[* TO 2018]",
}
```

By using a range query on `yearBuilt`, we can find every property that is no older than 2018.

Here is a sample of what this transactional data may look like.

```json
 "transactions": [
   {
     "saleDate": "2023-01-08T00:00:00.000Z",
     "documentType": "Grant Deed",
     "price": 173000,
     "sellerFirstName": "Seanot",
     "sellerLastName": "Hembree",
     "buyerFirstName": "clif",
     "buyerLastName": "Mccurley",
     "loanType": "Conventional",
     "parcelNumber": "056-670-034-000",
     "contactOwnerMailAddressFull": "18158 OLD WARDS FERRY RD"
   }
 ]
```

## Find the people data record

> 📘 Data Freshness Notice – Owner & Transaction Data
>
> Homeowner contact details and transaction records are typically available within 2 weeks after a property is marked as sold. This brief processing window allows us to validate, normalize, and match deed and ownership updates to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives.

## Using autotrace to combine people and property data

A newer feature to Datafiniti is the ability to cross reference people found in the property data with our people data. This can be done using the property data's auto\_trace feature. The auto\_trace feature is a key generated and linked to a people data record key. Allow for a single API call to pull both property and people data for the homer in one record.

```json
{
  "query":"country:US AND transactions.buyerFirstName:* AND propertyType:(\"Multi-Family Dwelling\" OR land) AND transactions.saleDate:[2023-01-01 TO *] AND yearBuilt:[* TO 2018] AND people.people_key:*",
  "num_records":10,
  "auto_trace":true,
  "only_traceable":true
}
```

Which will provide result like this: (note the result here have been condense for viewing)

> For more information on our auto\_trace feature, you can read more about it here: [Autotrace](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/autotrace)

> 📘 Comparing buyer data to Datafiniti's people data
>
> After compiling a list of records with first names, last names, and general locational geographics, you can query Datafiniti's people database to find out more info.
>
> Please visit our documentation on [gathering people contact information](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/gather-people-contact-information) to learn how to query people data.   This will allow you to gather phones, emails, and other contact information for reaching out to new home buyers.

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.
