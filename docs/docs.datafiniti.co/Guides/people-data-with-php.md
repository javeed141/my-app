# People Data with PHP

For this guide, we're going to assume the following you're interested in using Datafiniti's people data to develop a sales campaign.  Let's say you're a growth marketer that's been tasked with the following:

1. Collect email addresses of CEOs.
2. Refine that list to a specific geographic region.

**Your environment and data needs:**

1. You're working with PHP.
2. You want to work with CSV or JSON data.

Here are the steps we'll take:

## 1. Get your API token

The next thing you'll need is your API token.  The API token lets you authenticate with Datafiniti API and tells it who you are, what you have access to, and so on.  Without it, you can't use the API.

To get your API token, go the [Datafiniti Web Portal (https://portal.datafiniti.co)](https://portal.datafiniti.co/settings), login, and click your settings in the left navigation bar.  From there, you'll see a page showing your token.  Your API token will be a long string of letters and numbers.  Copy the API token or store it somewhere you can easily reference.

> 📘 API Key
>
> For the rest of this document, we'll use `AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX` as a substitute example for your actual API token when showing example API calls.

> 🚧 API Key Regen
>
> For security reasons, your API token will be automatically changed whenever you change your password.

## 2. Run your first search

The first thing we'll do is do a test search that will give us a sense for what sort of data might be available.  Eventually we'll refine our search so that we get back the most relevant data.

Since we want CEOs, let's try a simple search that will just give us people with that title.

Write the following code in your code editor (replace the dummy API token with your real API token):

```php
<?php

$url = 'https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/people/search';

// Set your API parameters here.
$APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';
// $format = 'CSV'; for CSV format 
$format = 'JSON';
$query = 'jobTitle:CEO';
$num_records = 1;
$download = false;

$request_body = array(
	'query' => $query,
	'format' => $format,
	'num_records' => $num_records,
	'download' => $download
);

$options = array(
	'http' => array (
		'header'  => "Authorization: Bearer " . $APIToken . "\r\n" . 
					 "Content-Type: application/json\r\n",
		'method'  => 'POST',
		'content' => json_encode($request_body)
	)
);

$context  = stream_context_create($options);
$result = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);
if ($result === FALSE) {
	echo "Error.";
} else {
	var_dump($result);
}

?>
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```json
Array
(
    [num_found] => 357
    [total_cost] => 1
    [records] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [address] => 9855 Melbourne Ave
                    [businessName] => MICHIGAN MARKETING EXTREME LLC
                    [city] => Allen Park
                    [country] => US
                    [dateAdded] => 2018-02-20T00:33:45Z
                    [dateUpdated] => 2018-02-20T00:33:45Z
                    [emails] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => billmey@michiganmarketingextreme.com
                        )

                    [firstName] => Bill
                    [keys] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => billmeymichiganmarketingextremecom
                        )

                    [lastName] => Mey
                    [jobFunction] => Business Management
                    [jobLevel] => C-Team
                    [jobTitle] => CEO
                    [numEmployeesMin] => 1
                    [numEmployeesMax] => 19
                    [phones] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => 7346190715
                        )
  
                    [postalCode] => 48101
                    [province] => MI

  									[sourceURLs] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => https://datafiniti.co
                        )

                    [id] => AVwcsllU_7pvs4fzx-yW
                )

        )

)
```

Let's break down each of the parameters we sent in our request:

| API Call Component        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"query": "jobTitle:CEO"` | `query` tells the API what query you want to use.  In this case, you're telling the API you want to search by `jobTitle`.  Any person that has `CEO` listed in its `jobTitle` field will be returned. |
| `"num_records": 1`        | `num_records` tells the API how many records to return in its response.  In this case, you just want to see 1 matching record.                                                                        |
| `"format":"xxxx"`         | `format` tells the API what format to output the data in the response. Can be either `CSV` or `JSON`                                                                                                  |

Now let's dive through the response the API returned:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Response Field",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "`\"num_found\"`",
    "0-1": "The total number of available records in the database that match your query.  If you end up downloading the entire data set, this is how many records you'll use.",
    "1-0": "`\"total_cost\"`",
    "1-1": "The number of credits this request has cost you.  People records have a record cost multiplier tied to them.  [See pricing](https://datafiniti.co/pricing/people-data-pricing/).",
    "2-0": "`\"records\"`",
    "2-1": "The first available matches to your query. If there are no matches, this field will be empty.  \n  \nWithin each record returned, you'll see multiple fields shown.  This is the data for each record."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 3,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

Within the `records` field, you'll see a single person returned with multiple fields and the values associated with that product.  The JSON response will show all fields that have a value.  It won't show any fields that don't have a value.

Each product record will have multiple fields associated with it.  You can see a full list of available fields in our [People Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/people-data-schema).

## 3. Refine your search

Let's say we decided to adjust our sales campaign to only target CEOs in Austin, TX.

Modify your code to look like this:

```php
<?php

$url = 'https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/people/search';

// Set your API parameters here.
$APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';
$format = 'JSON';
$query = 'jobTitle:CEO AND province:TX AND city:Austin';
$num_records = 10;
$download = false;

$request_body = array(
	'query' => $query,
	'format' => $format,
	'num_records' => $num_records,
	'download' => $download
);

$options = array(
	'http' => array (
		'header'  => "Authorization: Bearer " . $APIToken . "\r\n" . 
					 "Content-Type: application/json\r\n",
		'method'  => 'POST',
		'content' => json_encode($request_body)
	)
);

$context  = stream_context_create($options);
$result = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);
if ($result === FALSE) {
	echo "Error.";
} else {
	var_dump($result);
}

?>
```

This API call is different in a couple ways:

1. It adds ` AND province:TX AND city:Austin` to narrow down results to just people working in Austin, TX.
2. It changes `"num_records": 1` to `"num_records": 10` so we can look at more sample matches.

Notice how Datafiniti lets you construct very refined boolean queries.  In the API call above, we're using a combination of `AND` queries to get exactly what we want.

If you would like to narrow your search to just exact matches you can place the search term in quotation marks.

```php
<?php

$url = 'https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/people/search';

// Set your API parameters here.
$APIToken = 'AAAXXXXXXXXXXXX';
//var format = 'CSV';
$format = 'JSON';
$query = 'jobTitle:"Product Developer"';
$num_records = 10;
$download = false;

$request_body = array(
	'query' => $query,
	'format' => $format,
	'num_records' => $num_records,
	'download' => $download
);

$options = array(
	'http' => array (
		'header'  => "Authorization: Bearer " . $APIToken . "\r\n" . 
					 "Content-Type: application/json\r\n",
		'method'  => 'POST',
		'content' => json_encode($request_body)
	)
);

$context  = stream_context_create($options);
$result = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);
if ($result === FALSE) {
	echo "Error.";
} else {
	var_dump($result);
}

?>
```

The above query will only return people with the exact title of Product Developer.

## 4. Initiate a download of the data

Once we like what we see from the sample matches, it's time to download a larger data set!  To do this, we're going to update our code a fair bit (an explanation follows):

```php
<?php

$request_url = 'https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/people/search';

// Set your API parameters here.
$API_token = 'AAAXXXXXXXX';
$format = 'CSV';
$query = 'jobTitle:CEO AND province:TX AND city:Austin';
$num_records = 20;
$download = true;

$request_body = array(
	'query' => $query,
  'num_records' => $num_records,
	'format' => $format,
	'download' => $download
);

$request_options = array(
	'http' => array (
		'header'  => "Authorization: Bearer " . $API_token . "\r\n" . 
					 "Content-Type: application/json\r\n",
		'method'  => 'POST',
		'content' => json_encode($request_body)
	)
);

// Make the initial API call.
echo "Making initial request...\n";
print_r($request_options);
$request_context  = stream_context_create($request_options);
$request_response = file_get_contents($request_url, false, $request_context);

if ($request_response === FALSE) {

	echo "Error.";
	var_dump($request_response);

} else {

	echo "Download request successful:\n";
	$request_response_array = json_decode($request_response,true);
	print_r($request_response_array);

	$download_id = $request_response_array['id'];
	$download_url = 'https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/downloads/' . $download_id;
	$download_options = array(
		'http' => array (
			'header'  => "Authorization: Bearer " . $API_token . "\r\n",
			'method'  => 'GET'
		)
	);
	$download_status = 'running';
	while ($download_status != 'completed') {
		sleep(10);
		echo "Checking on status: " . $download_url . "\n";
		$download_context  = stream_context_create($download_options);
		$download_response = file_get_contents($download_url, false, $download_context);		
		$download_response_array = json_decode($download_response,true);
		$download_status = $download_response_array['status'];
		echo "Records downloaded: " . $download_response_array['num_downloaded'] . "\n";
	}

	if ($download_status == 'completed') {
		$result_list = $download_response_array['results'];
		for ($i = 0; $i < count($result_list); $i++) {
			$result_link = $result_list[$i];
			$filename = $download_id . "_" . $i . "." . $format;
			file_put_contents($filename, fopen($result_link, 'r'));
			echo "File " . ($i+1) . " out of " . count($result_list) . " saved: " . $filename . "\n";
		}
	}
}

?>
```

A few things to pay attention to in the above code:

1. We change `num_records` from `10` to `20`.  This will download the first 20 matching records.  If we wanted to download all matching records, we would remove `num_records`. `num_records` will tell the API to default to all available records.
2. We changed `format` from `JSON` to `CSV`.  We'll want to view the files in CSV format, so it will be easier to look at.
3. We changed `download` from `false` to `true`.

> 🚧 Num\_records
>
> If num\_records is not specified, ALL of the records matching the query will be downloaded.

Since we've handled multiple steps of the download process in this code, we won't go into the details here, but we do recommend you familiarize yourself with those steps.  Checking them out in our other guides [Getting started with People Data](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/getting-started-with-people-data).

## 5. Parse the data

### Open the result file(s) in Excel

For files formatted as CSV, you will receive you files as \<downloadID\_#>.csv. You can navigate to the file you downloaded and open it.  Since it's a CSV file, it should open in Excel automatically.  It will look something like:

![](https://files.readme.io/e200451-people.png "people.png")

### Parse JSON data

The download code will save one or more result files to your project folder.

> 📘 JSON Format
>
> The JSON data will actually be a text file, instead of a single JSON object. Each line in the text file is a JSON object. We format the data this way because most programming languages won't handle parsing the entire data set as a JSON object with their standard system calls very well.

We'll need to parse the file into an array of JSON objects.  We can use code similar to this to handle the parsing:

```php
<?php

// Set the location of your file here
$file = "xxxx_x.txt";

$records = array();

$handle = fopen($file, "r");
if ($handle) {
	while (($line = fgets($handle)) !== false) {
		$records[] = json_decode(($line));
	}
} else {
	echo "Error opening file.";
}

foreach($records as $record) {
	// Edit these lines to do more with the data.
	print_r($record);
}

?>
```

You can edit the code in the `foreach` loop above to do whatever you'd like with the data, such as store the data in a database, write it out to your console, etc.
