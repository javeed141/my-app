# Search latitude & longitude for properties

## Introduction

One popular use case for Datafiniti's Property Data is finding properties near a specific geo-coordinate that match certain criteria.  Here's how to do this!

## Searching around latitude & longitude

Let's say you have the following latitude and longitude coordinates:

```json
{
  "latitude": 30.253540,
  "longitude": -97.770640
}
```

You can run a search for properties near this geo-coordinate like so:

## Using Radial Search

You can use geoLocation to search in a radius of a Longitude and Latitude. The following example will show you how to build a query.

```json
{
	"query": "geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi]"
}
```

This will return all matching properties within a 10 mile radius.  You can change the `10` and the `mi` to other values you want, like `5,km` for 5 kilometers.

## Search the Most Recent Records

This will pull just the mostRecentStatus of "For Sale" properties in the area from the provided date to the present date.

```json
{
	"query": "geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND dateUpdated:[2023-03-14 TO *]"  
}
```

## Adding more filters

You probably want to be more specific than every property available, so you can additional filters like this:

```json
{
	"query": "geoLocation:[-97.7430600,30.2671500,10,mi] AND propertyType:(\"Single Family Dwelling\" OR Apartment)"
}
```

This will narrow down your matches to properties that are single family homes or apartments.  You can add any additional filters from the fields [available in our schema](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema).
