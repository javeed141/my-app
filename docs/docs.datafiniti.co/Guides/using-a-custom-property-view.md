# Using a custom property view on the fly

## Introduction

Many Datafiniti customers are interested in using our property data with only specific fields in the record results of a query. In this guide, we will show you a couple of ways to set up a custom view.

## Setting a view in your Property Search API

Whenever you set up your property search API body you can create a view by declaring the fields in the JSON of the body. Let's use the following query as a base for a property search:

```json
{
    "query":"country:US AND province:TX AND city:\"el paso\" AND address:* AND transactions:*",
    "num_records":20
}
```

Now let's add the view to the body that allows only the following fields:

* address
* city
* province
* postalCode
* transaction
  * buyerFirstName
  * buyerLastName

```json
{
    "query": "country:US AND province:TX AND city:\"el paso\" AND address:* AND transactions:*",
    "view": [
        {"name": "address"},
        {"name": "city"},
        {"name": "province"},
        {"name": "postalCode"},
        {"name": "transactions","flatten": true, "sub_fields": [
            {"name": "saleDate"},
            {"name": "buyerFirstName"},
            {"name": "buyerLastName"}
          ]
        }
    ],
    "num_records":20
}
```

Here is an example of the download of this view:

## Creating a custom view via create view API endpoint

This method will create a permanent view that you can declare by name in the view of your search body. Using the <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/views> API endpoint you can create a view. We will use the previous fields as our view body. We will name this view `custom_transaction_view`.

```json
{
  "name": "custom_transaction_view",
  "data_type": "property",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "address"},
        {"name": "city"},
        {"name": "province"},
        {"name": "postalCode"},
        {"name": "transactions","flatten": true, "sub_fields": [
            {"name": "saleDate"},
            {"name": "buyerFirstName"},
            {"name": "buyerLastName"}
          ]
        }
  ]
}
```

> 📘 Name
>
> Please note you can name the view any string value not currently used. To check your current view you can use: <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/views?page=1&limit=10>

> 🚧 dataType
>
> Be sure that you declare the correct dataType to the dataType you wish to search. As we need to match the API to the dataType's schema. Learn more about [Property Data Schema](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-schema).
