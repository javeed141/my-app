# Identifying employees targeted by cyberattacks

# Introduction

By providing a commercially-available database of personally-identifiable information (PII), Datafiniti's People Data can be used to protect companies against potential cyberattacks. Let's learn how!

## Searching against a known target list

If your company provides cybersecurity protection, you likely have access to lists of known compromised individuals These lists will likely contain name, email, and other identifiers for each person. A list may look like:

```
Name, Email
Joe Curry, joe.curry@universallumpers.com
Tina Harris, tharris@gmail.com
Luis Fiego, luis42@plymouth.edu
```

You can take information like this and use it to find matching individuals in our people database. For this search we will build a filtered search based on `firstName`, `lastName`, & `emails`. Here's how such a search might look:

## Aggregating data to identify compromised companies

As you match each person and find their current company, you can append the data to your original file:

```
Name, Email, Company
Joe Curry, joe.curry@bellideas.com, universal lumpers inc.	
Tina Harris, tharris@gmail.com, quickpro
Luis Fiego, luis42@plymouth.edu, plymouth university
```

Once you've done so, you can count up the companies in your updated list to find which companies may be compromised more severely than others.
