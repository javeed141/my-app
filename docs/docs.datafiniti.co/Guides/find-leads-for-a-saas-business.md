# Find leads for a SaaS business

# Introduction

A popular use case for Datafiniti's People Data is lead generation for sales campaigns.  You can use our People Data to find leads that match a wide variety of criteria.

In this example, we'll show you how to find leads for a fictional SaaS (software-as-a-service) business

# Developing your search query

When generating a lead list, you're likely to start by searching for specific job titles that match who will be making buying decisions.  We can use the `jobTitle` field for this.

```json
{
  "query": "jobTitle:\"Product Manager\""
}
```

This will return several matching records, like this one:

```json
{
    "num_found": 41693,
    "total_cost": 10,
    "records": [
        {

            "id": "OmYQe4YBnlMipTIrXMUH"
        }
      ]
}
```

The matching record is for a person that works in the industrial engineering field.  You may want to target a specific industry, which you can do by searching on the `businessCategories` field:

```json
{
  "query": "jobTitle:\"Product Manager\" AND businessCategories:\"financial services\""
}
```

## Getting a count of managers

If you want to make sure that all leads that come back have an email and phone number, you can use our count feature to see the number of records before downloading the results

```json
{
  "query": "jobTitle:\"Product Manager\" AND businessCategories:\"financial services\" AND professionalEmails:* AND phones:*",
  "num_records":0
}
```

The response from this request:

```json
{
    "num_found": 1026
}
```

If you would like to check the records with in this query you can pull a small amount of records to do some spot checking:

```json
{
  "query": "jobTitle:\"Product Manager\" AND businessCategories:\"financial services\" AND professionalEmails:* AND phones:*",
  "num_records":10
}
```

This will make sure the leads that come back have data like this:

```json
"professionalEmails": [
  "greg@givingassistant.org"
],
"phones": [
  "+1 845-920-0300"
],
```

# Downloading your lead list

Once you've developed the exact search criteria you want, you can download all matching results into a lead list like so:

```json
{
  "query": "jobTitle:(\"product manager\") AND businessCategories:\"financial services\" AND professionalEmails:* AND phones:*",
  "download": true,
  "format": "CSV",
  "num_records":1026
}
```

This will generate a CSV file with each field in our [people data schema](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/people-data-schema) in a separate column.
