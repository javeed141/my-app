# 2025.08 - Data Release Log

We’re excited to bring you several new updates this month across our Property, People, and Business datasets—each designed to improve your access to timely, accurate data.

# Property Data: Clearer Rental Statuses

We’re introducing a major improvement to how rental statuses are tracked in our property data schema. This change better distinguishes rental-related statuses from for sale statuses, offering enhanced clarity and precision in your analysis.\
This update includes:

* A new top-level rentalStatuses field
* Refined tracking via `mostRecentRentalStatus, mostRecentRentalStatusDate, and mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen`

As mentioned in our previous announcement, this is part of our ongoing effort to separate rental indicators from broader listing data. [Property Data](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/api-property-data)

## New County Coverage: Dane County, Wisconsin

We’ve expanded our coverage to include Dane County, WI—providing more comprehensive property data in this high-demand region.

# People Data

## New Listing Price Fields

You’ll now find two new fields in our people data schema:

* minListingPrice
* maxListingPrice

These fields help users better understand an individual’s property price range involvement and can enhance lead scoring, targeting, and segmentation strategies.

# Business Data

## New State Source Added

We’ve added a new state-level data source to improve business coverage in Rhode Island:

* business.sos.ri.gov — the official RI Secretary of State business registry.

This means more direct, up-to-date records for businesses operating in Rhode Island.

# Coming soon

## New Commercial Property Top Level Fields

Big changes are on the horizon for commercial property data. We're upgrading how commercial listings are structured by promoting key fields from the features array to top-level schema fields—making them easier to query, filter, and analyze.

Expect clearer insights into:

* Net Operating Income (NOI)
* Tenant Mix
* Occupancy Rates
* Building Class
* Investment Highlights
* Virtual Tours

…and many more fields designed to supercharge your commercial property workflows.
