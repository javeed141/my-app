{/* Unknown component:  */}

export const ExampleComponent = (`{ children }`) => `{
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {children}`
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};


  Here’s a very simple example component rather than an empty state. This should help you figure out what's happening quicker and see what's possible with custom components!
