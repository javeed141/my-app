# Requests

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  All requests to the Pipedrive API must be made over SSL (https, not http).
</Callout>

Pipedrive APIs use JSON in the requests bodies. To ensure a proper JSON-formatted request, provide `Content-Type: application/json` in your HTTP request headers. Our API supports UTF-8 for character encoding.

For API v1, the `POST` method also supports a form-encoded body, but you might run into issues with data types. [API v2](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/pipedrive-api-v2), however, only accepts JSON bodies for all requests. Our API uses the HTTP verbs for each action:

| Method   | Description                                 |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Used for retrieving resources               |
| `POST`   | Used for creating resources                 |
| `PUT`    | Used for replacing resources or collections |
| `PATCH`  | Used for updating some parts of a resource  |
| `DELETE` | Used for deleting resources                 |

## URL naming

<hr />

Our API uses a straightforward URL naming convention.

* Each request must be made to the API endpoint `https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v2`, followed by the type of object in a plural form, for example, `https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v2/deals`
* When one item is being asked, and such a method exists, the ID of the item must be appended to the URL, for example `https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v2/deals/2`
* When asking for sub-objects of an object, append that to the ID of the master object, for example, `https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v2/deals/2/activities`

We advise everyone to use `{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com` for faster requests as it helps us to better determine which data center your request should go to.

## Field selector

<hr />

When asking for a collection/list of objects, you can pass in a field selector to indicate which fields you would like to fetch per each object. Most v1 endpoints in our [API reference](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/) support this, but not all.

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  Support for field selectors has been removed from [API v2](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/pipedrive-api-v2).
</Callout>

The field selector is supported in requests done with OAuth and requests done with the `api_token`. For example, you may only want to fetch a deal's ID, title, value, and currency when asking the deals list – this can be done by using the following syntax:

```text URL
GET https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v1/deals:(id,title,value,currency)
```

You can also see the field selector being used in our [updating custom fields' values](https://developers.pipedrive.com/tutorials/update-custom-field-pipedrive-api) tutorial.
