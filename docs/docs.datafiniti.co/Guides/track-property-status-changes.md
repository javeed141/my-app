# Track property status changes

## Introduction

Many Datafiniti customers are interested in using our property data to track the status of property as they on/off the market. This guide will show you how to track this feed from historical to daily.

## Finding the most recent status change

Datafiniti allows you to search on the most recent changes to the data in the record itself. For this example we will be looking for the most recent *For Sale* homes in Houston, Texas for the last 30 days since July 1st. Here is the query:

```json
{
    "query": "country:\"US\" AND province:TX AND city:houston AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen:[2023-07-01 TO *]",
    "num_records": 10
}
```

We used a combination of `mostRecentStatus `and `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen `to limit this query to only *For Sale* status. `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen `will state the date when the `mostRecentStatus `changed last.

> 📘 mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen vs mostRecentStatusDate
>
> Please note that `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen` is a static field that show when the status change was first made. `mostRecentStatusDate` is a fluid field that will update even if the status is verified to be the same.

We are using a wildcard ended range to dictate the till present date. Please change your date range to which ever represent your use case better.

> 📘 For sale vs rental statuses
>
> Please note that Datafiniti tracks for sale and rental statuses separately, so if you are looking for rental statuses please use mostRecentRentalStatus.

## Verify a non-rental status of a property

Based off of our previous example we are going to check if the status of the address *1914 Augusta Dr Unit 21* is still for sale. We will use the following query to do so:

```json
{
    "query": "country:\"US\" AND province:TX AND city:houston AND address:\"1914 Augusta Dr Unit 21\"",
    "num_records": 1
}
```

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

Please note there are many statuses in regards to a non-rental property. You can see our full list of statuses [Possible Values for Property Fields](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/possible-values-for-property-fields)

This will return the following property data. We will focus on the most recent data fields for this example.

```json
{
	
	"mostRecentPriceDomain": "www.redfin.com",
	"mostRecentPriceSourceURL": "https://www.redfin.com/TX/Houston/1914-Augusta-Dr-77057/unit-21/home/30396468",
  "mostRecentSaleListPriceAmount": 227900,
"mostRecentSaleListPriceDate": "2023-08-08T15:42:45.733Z",
	"mostRecentStatus": "For Sale",
	"mostRecentStatusDate": "2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z",
	"mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen": "2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

We can see that the property has been on the market for longer than 14 days by comparing `mostRecentStatusDate `to `mostRecentStatusFirstDateSeen`. Using this method will allow you boarder insight on market trends in your area with any query you search with.

# Tracking Rental Status Transitions

While the existing guide focuses on sale-related changes, many users deal with rental markets or want to monitor when properties shift between being occupied and available. Tracking `rentalStatus` offers insights into vacancy cycles, market demand, and property usage trends.

## Relevant fields & properties

Assuming Datafiniti supports analogous fields for rentals akin to sales status, the key properties likely include:

* `mostRecentRentalStatus` – current rental availability (e.g., “Available,” “Rented,” “Off Market”).
* `mostRecentRentalStatusDate`  – the timestamp when the current rental status was last observed.
* `mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen` – when that particular status was first recorded.

> 📘 Relevant Fields Not Present
>
> If these fields don’t already exist, it is safe to assume the property record does not have any rental status data.

## Querying Recent Rental Availability

Here’s an example query to find properties recently listed as Available for rent in Austin, Texas, within the last 30 days:

```json
{  
  "query": "country:\"US\" AND province:TX AND city:austin AND mostRecentRentalStatus:\"Rental\" AND mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen:[2025-07-15 TO *]",  
  "num_records": 10  
}
```

How this works:

* `mostRecentRentalStatus`: "Rental" filters properties currently available for rent.
* The date range on `mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen` ensures you're only seeing those newly marked as available.

## Verifying Rental Status of a Specific Property

To check whether a given property is still available or has changed, execute a query using its address:

```json
{  
  "query": "country:\"US\" AND province:TX AND city:austin AND address:\"122 Elm Street\"",  
  "num_records": 1  
}
```

Review the returned JSON for fields similar to the following:

```json
{  
  "mostRecentRentalStatus": "Rented",  
  "mostRecentRentalStatusDate": "2025-08-14T08:30:00.000Z",  
  "mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen": "2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"  
}
```

You’ll know the property was first marked as “`Rented`” on August 1, 2025, and remains in that status as of the latest check on August 14, 2025.

### Interpreting Rental Status Durations

By comparing `mostRecentRentalStatusDate` to `mostRecentRentalStatusFirstDateSeen`, you can estimate how long a property has been in its current rental state. This is helpful for:

* Gauging average rental turnaround times.
* Identifying unusually long vacancies.
* Spotting high-demand markets via rapid re-leasing.
