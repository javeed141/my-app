# Pagination

The search endpoint for the API will return up to 50 records with each response, but of course, many searches have many more matching records.  If you don't want to download every result, but do want to pull additional records, you can use the API's pagination to see more records.

## Pagination request

The pagination endpoint is very similar to the [search endpoint](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/property-data-with-curl#3-run-your-first-search).  Here's an example request:

```curl
POST <https://api.datafiniti.co/v4/properties/paginate?page=1&limit=500>
```

The pagination endpoint uses the following parameters:

* `page` - Which section of results you want returned, up to 10000.
* `limit` - The number of results returned with each page, up to 500.

> 🚧 Credit limit with pagination
>
> Please note that with pagination you can query more records at once, so be careful that your parameters don't result in using up all of your available record credits.

The query structure remains the same.  Here's an example:

```json
{
  "query": "numBedroom:[3 TO *] AND numBathroom:[2 TO *] AND propertyType:(\"Single Family Dwelling\" OR \"Multi-Family Dwelling\") AND mostRecentStatus:\"For Sale\" AND mostRecentPriceAmount:[1 TO *] AND mostRecentPriceCurrency:\"USD\" AND country:\"US\" AND city:\"Denton\" AND province:\"TX\"""
}
```

Pagination doesn't require `download` or `num_records` like the search endpoint does.

Your response will look something like:

```json
{
    "num_found": 886,
    "total_cost": 500,
    "people_cost": 0,
    "property_cost": 500,
