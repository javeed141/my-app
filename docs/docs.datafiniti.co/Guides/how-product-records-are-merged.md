# How Product Records Are Merged

For each record we collect, we generate 1 or more `keys` for the record.  Each key value is based on different unique identifiers that are available from the record's data.  If we see a different record with 1 or more of the same `keys` values, we will merge these two records.

For example, we may generate a product record like this when crawling a web page:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"name\": \"Tectronics CD Player\",\n  \"manufacturer\": \"Tectronics\",\n  \"manufacturerNumber\": \"A342\",\n  \"upc\": \"014045125963\"\n}",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

This record will generate the following `keys`:

```
"keys": [
  "Tectronics/A432",
  "014045125963"
]
```

Let's say we then crawl another web page for the same product and generate this data:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"name\": \"Tectronics CD Player\",\n  \"colors\": [\n  \t\"black\",\n    \"red\"\n  ],\n  \"upc\": \"014045125963\"\n}",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

This record will generate the following `keys`:

```
"keys": [
  "014045125963"
]
```

When we import both of these records into our product database, the records will merge, since they share at least one key value.  The resulting record will be:

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"name\": \"Tectronics CD Player\",\n  \"colors\": [\n  \t\"black\",\n    \"red\"\n  ],\n  \"manufacturer\": \"Tectronics\",\n  \"manufacturerNumber\": \"A342\",\n  \"keys\": [\n \t\t\"Tectronics/A432\",\n  \t\"014045125963\"\n  ],\n  \"upc\": \"014045125963\"\n}",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

Product records use the following fields to generate keys:

* `brand`
* `ean`
* `isbn`
* `manufacturer`
* `manufacturerNumber`
* `upc`
* `vin`
* `websiteIDs`

`brand` and `manufacturer` are always used in conjunction with `manufacturerNumber`.
