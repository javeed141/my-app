# Identify e-commerce orders shipping to vacant houses

# Introduction

One of the more creative uses of Datafiniti is using our property data to track potentially fraudulent e-commerce orders.  Fraudsters may attempt to ship packages to a vacant home and pick up those packages from those houses because they know no one is living there.  Online retailers can use our property data to check the shipping addresses against the addresses of recently listed or sold homes to flag potentially fraudulent orders.

Here's a brief overview of how this process works.

# Step 1: Collect a list of recent shipping addresses

As new orders come in, collect the shipping addresses on each order.  That list might look something like:

```
Address, City, State, Zip
1023 Jollyville Rd, Houston, TX, 77079
451 Webber Ln, Austin, TX 78721
200 Tennyson Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213
```

> 📘 Address normalization
>
> Datafiniti uses standardized street name normalization. Converting `street` to `st`, `drive` to `dr`, etc, you can learn more about our address normalization here: [Normalized Property Addresses](https://docs.datafiniti.co/docs/normalized-address-data)\
> If you wish to exactly match addresses to Datafiniti's property data, you will need to use this normalization method.

# Step 2: Check an MLS address against Datafiniti

Pass each address (provided by your or an MLS network) to the Datafiniti Property API and check the status of the property.  Your query will look like:

```json
{
  "query": "address:\"200 Tennyson Ave\" AND city:Pittsburgh AND province:PA AND postalCode:15213"
}
```

If there's a match, you'll get data back on the most recent status of the property.  The data in the returned property record will look like:

```json
"mostRecentStatus": "For Sale",
"mostRecentStatusDate": "2023-03-28T15:34:20.727Z",
```

# Step 3: Flag properties recently listed or sold

If the address matches a property that is recently listed (`For Sale`) or sold (`Sold`), then you can decide to flag that corresponding order as potentially fraudulent.

## Conclusion

You can utilize the address with property status to build a report to calculate if the address is legitimate or not. This will help online retailers protect themselves against fraudulent orders.
